# DIRECTIVE ON PUBLIC SERVICE INFORMATION SECURITY  

# Preface  

The current digital era has seen the increased importance of data and information, thus giving it the status of being the economy's raw material. It has brought the importance of protecting data and information to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  

The persistent cybersecurity incidents in the Public service reveal the level of vulnerability that the government departments are exposed to with limited ICT security skills to mitigate and combat the cyber-attacks as they emerge.  

In line with this, section $3(1)(\hat{I})$ of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation No. 103 of 1994) provides for the Minister of Public Service and Administration (MINiSTER) to establish norms and standards relating to information management in the public service.  

Furthermore, requlation 94 of the Public Service Regulations, 2016, specifically provides for the MiNiSTER to issue information security standards for the public service after consultation with relevant Ministers.  

This Directive is issued by the MiNiSTER in terms of section 41(3) of the Public Service Act to elucidate regulations 94, of the Public Service Regulations.

A user's identity must be confirmed before resetting a password, providing a temporary password, or issuing a new password.   
d) Initial passwords issued to new users or when a password is reset are temporary, forcing the user to change the password immediately when he/she logs in to the network with the new password.   
e) New or changed passwords are communicated to a user securely. The use of electronic mail messages should be avoided when communicating issued passwords.   
f) Passwords are changed immediately if there is an indication of system or password compromise.   
g) All stored passwords are encrypted.   
h) Default system administrator account passwords are changed immediately upon installation, default administrator accounts are renamed where applicable, and  the system and guest accounts are disabled   
i) Multifactor authentication (MFA) is used on critical systems to enhance security measures by providing an additional layer of protection using a combination of authentication factors (OTP, Graphical passwords(CAPTCHAs), Biometrics ).  

# 22. MOBILE AND REMOTE COMPUTING
