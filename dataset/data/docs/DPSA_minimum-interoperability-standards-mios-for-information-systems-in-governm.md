# 1.1 INTRODUCTION  

(1) The South African Government, as represented by its National, Provincial and Local departments and associated agencies, is committed to the continuous improvement of public service delivery. Such commitment has become an underlying theme across all departments’ strategic and annual performance plans. Following on this commitment government ICT leaders have embarked on an e-Government programme in 2001, which aspires to achieve the effective, efficient and economic management and utilisation of Information and ICT Resources in government as illustrated in the Government ICT House of Value).  

![](images/e8e657056a713cee44120e45223b541c6063427753c9f9f09f25188f2cfe37a8.jpg)  
Figure 1: Government ICT House of Value  

(2) The ICT House of Value serves as a reference to measure the performance of e-Government projects and systems, which includes interoperability1. The strategic drive to advance the maturity on interoperability not only compels government ICT leaders to collaborate on e-Government initiatives by sharing scarce resources, but it also provides a way for information to be exchanged electronically across traditional government system boundaries in order to improve public service delivery.  

(3) The ICT House of value, comprises a roof, pillars and foundation, each representing the following:  

(a) The outcomes (roof) of the e-Government programme on public sector operations are to:  

(i) Lower cost of government service delivery operations, by reducing time, complexity, repetition and duplication of tasks.   
(ii) Increased productivity of government operations, by improving the quality and quantity of traditional public sector outputs or introduce new processes to produce outputs and render services that were previously impossible.   
(iii) Citizen Convenience when interacting with government, by offering equal access to government information systems and services, provides more and better information, improves information service quality and privacy, provides remedies for failures and offers best value for money2.  

(b) The value (pillars) that the e-Government programme contributes to the public sector ICT environment is:  

(i) Security, by ensuring that information systems and related technologies operate in a maintained security environment.   
(ii) Interoperability, by ensuring that information systems and ICT infrastructure of government can interconnect and exchange information.   
(iii) Reduced duplication, by eliminating unnecessary duplications, by promoting sharing and consolidation of Information systems and ICT infrastructure across government.   
(iv) Economies of scale, by leveraging collective purchasing power of government to lower unit prices from industry.   
(v) Digital inclusion, by promoting the South African ICT industry, with a particular emphasis on Brٟoad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), labour absorption, and stimulation of equitable economic growth and skills development of ICT in South Africa.  

(c) The capabilities (foundation) by which to achieve the outcomes and values of eGovernment are:  

(i) ICT planning, the capabilities that set direction and standards for ICT, Enterprise Architecture and to validate/certify conformance and performance thereto.   
(ii) ICT integration, the capabilities that provide and develop ICT Systems and Technology Infrastructure into integrated ICT solutions.   
(iii) ICT operations, the capabilities to ensure that ICT Systems and Technology Infrastructure are maintained in a reliable, available and secure environment.  

(4) The advancement of interoperability in Government is an ongoing process and should be managed as a long-term programme. It is therefore incumbent upon the members of the Government Information Technology Officers Council to promote the objectives of interoperability and to observe the principles and comply with the standards as set out in MIOS during the life-cycle management of IS/ICT in government. It is also essential that MIOS remains updated and that it aligns to stakeholder requirements, changes in legislative environment, so that government can embrace the potential of technological advancement in the market and address the archival issues inherent to the digital age.  

(5) The MIOS provides a set of mandatory standards that will ensure the achievement of the interoperability pillar in the ICT House of Value as illustrated in figure 1 above.  

# 1.2 MANDATE  

(1) Interoperability between Information Systems and Information-and-Communication Technology (IS/ICT) in government is mandated in accordance with the following legislation:  

(a) Public Service Act (Act 38 of 1994 as amended by Act 30 of 2007) mandates the Minister to establish norms and standards for Information Management in the Public Service and e-Government respectively;   
(b) Public Service Regulations 2001 (as amended 2001 to 2010) – (i) Obligates heads of departments to comply with the MIOS. (ii) Mandates the Minister to issue the MIOS. (iii) Mandates the GITO Council to review and recommend to the Minister any amendments to the MIOS.   
(c) State Information Technology Agency (SITA) Act (Act 88 of 1998 as amended by Act 38 of 2002) sections 7(6)(a)(i) and 7(6)(b) mandates SITA to set standards for interoperability between information systems in government and to certify information technology goods and services for compliance against such standards.   
(d) State Information Technology Agency General Regulation (R.50 of 2005) sections 4.2 and 4.3 prescribe the processes to set interoperability standards and to certify compliance of information systems thereto.   
(e) Public Finance Management Act (Act 1 of 1999 as amended by Act 29 of 1999) section 38(1)(b) and (d) holds an accounting officer responsible for the effective, efficient, economical and transparent use of the resources and to comply with audit commitments as required by legislation.  

# 1.3 PURPOSE AND BENEFITS  

(1) The purpose of the MIOS is to prescribe open system standards that will ensure minimum level of interoperability within and between IS/ICT systems that are utilised in government, industry, citizens and the international community in support of the e-Government objectives.  

(2) The benefits that MIOS provides to stakeholders are:  

(a) To government IS/ICT management communities, it provides a framework to ensure compliance with interoperability stipulations as set out in the SITA Act and Public Service Regulations respectively. It further underpins the collective value IS/ICT as a strategic resource of government that must be valued, shared and used to improve public service delivery.  

(b) To enterprise architects, solution architects, designers and implementers, it provides a basis for designing, using and implementing open standards based solutions to improve interoperability and reduce duplication across government IS/ICT.   
(c) To acquirers, it provides the minimum mandatory technical specifications that must form part of all bid documents.   
(d) To the Certification Authority, it serves as a baseline by which to verify and certify conformance of IS/ICT goods and services for use in government.   
(e) To SITA, it provides the technical standards that are required to function as the Prime Systems Integrator (PSI) for Government.   
(f) To ICT goods and service providers, it substantiates government’s strategic intent towards the adoption of and migration to open standards and that only MIOS compliant products be considered for integration into the Government Information Infrastructure.  

# 1.4 SCOPE  

1.4.1 Where does MIOS fit into the bigger picture?  

The MIOS is an integral part of the Government’s envisaged IS/ICT Governance Framework. It is also strongly related to, although not part of, the Government Wide Enterprise Architecture (GWEA) Framework (which sets the minimum standard for developing ICT Plans and Blueprints in government), because the MIOS prescribes the architecture model and notation standards needed to achieve interoperability among Enterprise Architecture tools and repositories, and the GWEA Framework, in turn, prescribes the adherence to MIOS during the development of ICT Plans and Blueprints in government.  

# 1.4.2 What is included in MIOS?  

The Minimum Interoperability Standard (MIOS) contains the following:  

(a) The management processes and responsibilities for – (i) the setting and approval of interoperability standards, and (ii) the certification of IS/ICT products and services for compliance with such standards; and   
(b) The set of interoperability standards regarding – (i) data format standards to enable exchange of data between government information systems (IS), and  

(ii) technical standards to interconnect, interoperate, access and exchange data among components of government Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure.  

# 1.4.3 What is excluded from MIOS?  

The MIOS does not prescribe any standards relating to business processes of IS/ICT services, except for the processes to set the standard and to certify compliance with such standards. The IS/ICT business process and service standards, such as ICT Governance practice standards, Enterprise Architecture practice standards, Information System Security practice standards, Quality Management practice standards, System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practice standard, Project Management practice standard and ICT Service Management standards form part of the prevailing and evolving Government IS/ICT Governance Framework as referenced in par (1.4.1) above.  

# 1.5 APPLICABILITY AND COMPLIANCE  

# 1.5.1 To whom does MIOS apply?  

The MIOS is normative – it is prescriptive and compliance is mandatory – to heads of National and Provincial departments and associated agencies/entities as listed in the Schedules to the Public Service Act, and it is informative – it is descriptive and compliance is not mandatory – to heads of Local Government.  

# 1.5.2 To what does MIOS apply?  

(1) According to the Public Service Regulation, Chapter 5 (e-Government), Part III, C – “C.1 The following systems shall comply with the MIOS:  

(a) every part of any new information system developed or acquired for the public service or any upgrade of any existing information system in the public service; and   
(b) every legacy system that is part of electronic service delivery in the public service.  

C.2 A head of department shall include compliance with the MIOS in the project approval procedure for the department. The MIOS shall be used in the audit and review of every project of a department.”  

(2) In context of e-Government, MIOS is applicable for compliance to all e-Government systems through their life-cycle of existence, where:  

(a) e-Government system means “any information system in the public service” and the interoperability of e-Government systems (as illustrated in Figure 2: e-Government information exchange scenarios), is described as  –  

(i) Government to Government (G2G) information system – any government information system that interconnects and exchanges information with another government information system (including any two information systems within a department).   
(ii) Government to Business (G2B) information system – any government information system that interconnects and exchanges information with a commercial or non-governmental business entity; and   
(iii) Government to Citizen (G2C) system – any government information system that interconnects and exchanges information with a citizen or community.  

![](images/d32dfdbc1de69fc3e3960d6b1575fbe05d64754e9c877b2e63f76d8c8b0778cb.jpg)  
Figure 2: e-Government information exchange scenarios  

(b) The  life-cycle stages and conditions when MIOS is applicable, are for –  

(i) A new e-Government system that is either under development or in acquisition;   
(ii) An e-Government system that is upgraded in functionality to enable new business processes or that is upgraded in terms of its technology infrastructure (i.e. same business processes and functionality, but new technology infrastructure)   
(iii) An existing (legacy) e-Government system in operation.  

# 1.5.3 Exemption from applicability  

(1) A department or agency may apply to the Minister to be exempted from complying with MIOS.  

(2) The MIOS is recommended for, and will not be subjected to compliance certification, for information systems that are –  

(a) Specific to the unique operational requirements of a Department or Agency, provided that such a system is not an e-Government system; or   
(b) Governed by strict international health or safety standards; or   
(c) Embedded systems or closed systems (such as electro-mechanical systems, closed surveillance systems and real-time monitoring systems) that does not interoperate or exchange data with another system.  

# 2.1 PRINCIPLES  

In addition to the legislation on IS/ICT in government, the following principles regarding MIOS serve as a basis for decision-making:  

(a) Approval of funding for the acquisition (including the development) of new or the modification of existing IS/ICT products or systems are dependant on the IS/ICT product or system being compliant with MIOS.   
(b) In terms of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) it is the responsibility of the accounting officer of a department or agency to ensure that IS/ICT projects and system comply with MIOS and that such compliance is subject to be audited/verified by the Auditor-general.   
(c) When interconnectivity, data interoperability or information access is required between departments’ or agencies’ systems, the cost of rectifying a system that does not comply with MIOS rests with the owner of the non-compliant product or system.  

# 2.2 STANDARD SETTING  

# 2.2.1 Standard Setting Responsibilities  

(1) The responsibilities and process for setting interoperability standards are governed in terms of the following legislation –  

(a) Public Service Act states:  

“3. (1) The Minister [of Public Service and Administration] is responsible for   
establishing norms and standards relating to –  … (f) information management in the public service; (g) electronic government;”  

(b) Public Service Regulations, Chapter 5, Part III, states:  

“B. MINIMUM INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS  

B.1 The Minister shall, after consultation with the Government Information Technology Officer Council (herein referred to as the “GITO Council”), issue Minimum Interoperability Standards (herein referred to as the “MIOS”) ...  

D. REVIEW OF MIOS  

For the purpose of recommending to the Minister new standards or the amendment or repeal of existing standards, the GITO Council shall from time to time review the MIOS.”  

(c) SITA Act, states: “7(6) The Agency  – (a) must set standards regarding – (i) the interoperability of information systems subject to the approval of the Minister; (b) must certify every acquisition of any information technology goods o services by a department for compliance with those standards.”  

(d) SITA General Regulations, states:  

“4.2 SETTING OF STANDARDS  

4.2.1 Before setting or amending standards regarding the interoperability of information systems between departments … in terms of section 7(6)(a) of the Act, the Agency must -  

(a) consult with departments and the GITO Council in order to assess the status of implemented systems and the proposed requirements;  

(b) conduct an implementation impact analysis and develop a business case demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of such standards; and  

(c) give due consideration to all representations received from departments and the GITO Council before submitting proposed standards, or an amendment thereof, to the Minister … for approval … .  

4.2.2 The Agency must set the standards, contemplated in section 7(6)(a) of the [SITA] Act, not later than a date determined by the Minister.”  

4.2.3 The standards set in terms of section 7(6)(a) of the [SITA] Act must be made available to all heads of departments and on the Agency's web site.”  

(2) Following above legislation, the stakeholders and their respective responsibilities regarding the setting of interoperability standards are –

# 2.2.2 Standard setting process  

(1) The task of advancing interoperability between information systems across the public sector is a complex and on-going process. The interoperability standards, as contained in MIOS, must support and enhance Government’s business processes, and also ensure that new technological advances and innovations are leveraged to their full advantage.  

(2) The process to review and set interoperability standards is inclusive. Therefore, all stakeholders, including Government Departments and their agencies, industry and the users are all encouraged to participate in improving interoperability, and to provide support on the implementation of the MIOS.  

(3) The process to review and set interoperability standards for inclusion in MIOS is a consultative decision-making process that comprises a few steps involving a rule based filtration of interoperability standards as illustrated in Figure 3: Standards selection and setting process, and described as follows –  

![](images/1b6df7409dfc1a0c969e0bc83034ca32d2a5d4bc940dea9d681b8abcd6e7cf85.jpg)  
Figure 3: Standards selection and setting process  

(a) Step1: Compile a list of standards for consideration – referred to as the “White List”. The White List is an unbounded (unscreened) list of new or revised interoperability standards that are suggested by all stakeholders to be considered by the standards setting task team for inclusion into MIOS. This list is compiled by means of the following activities –  

(i) Watch or keep abreast of standards development in the ICT market that involves periodic research into national and international standards development organisations and exploring the developments of other governments’ e-Government and interoperability programmes.   
(ii) Consult with and solicit inputs from government stakeholders and interoperability champions.   
(iii) Assess the effectiveness and relevance of the interoperability standards that are contained in the existing MIOS to identify standards that are not contributing (anymore) to the advancement of interoperability in government.  

(b) Step 2: Filter the “White List” using the standards selection principles (as contained in section 2.2.3 below) and produce a list of candidate standards – referred to as the “Grey List”. The standards setting task team considers each standard in the White List and test it for conformance with the standard selection principles –  

(i) A conformant standard is placed in the “Grey List”, which will be considered, subject to a further evaluation, for inclusion into MIOS.   
(ii) A non-conformant standard is discarded, and will not be considered for further evaluation.  

(c) Step 3: Assess the value and risks of standards in the “Grey List” and produce a list of recommended standards that will be added to or supersede existing standards in the MIOS – referred to as the “Green List”. The standards setting task team considers each standard in the Grey List and perform a benefit-risk impact assessment – (i) A standard that passes the benefit-risk impact assessment is placed on the “Green List” and will be added to or supersede existing standards in the MIOS. (ii) A standard that fails the benefit-risk impact assessment will be discarded and flagged as deprecated. A deprecated standard does not contribute to the advancement of interoperability in government anymore or it will introduce an unacceptable high risk to the public service delivery.  

# 2.2.3 Standards Selection Principles  

The following principles shall apply during the selection of interoperability standards for inclusion or amendment to the MIOS:  

(a) Interoperability: The standard is designed to advance interconnectedness and data exchange within and between e-Government systems.   
(b) Openness: the specifications for the standards is open, which is characterised by: (i) The standard should be maintained by a non-commercial organization. (ii) The standard developmentٟand decision-making processes are inclusive and open to all interested parties. (iii) The standards development outputs, including documents, drafts and completed standards, are accessible to anyone at no cost or at a negligible fee. (iv) The intellectual rights required to implement the standard (e.g. essential patent claims) are irrevocably available, without any royalties attached. (v) The standard must not favour or provide exclusive rights to a particular vendor or product brand.  

(c) Industry support: the standard is widely supported by the industry, and is likely to reduce the cost of and the risk inherent to e-Government systems.  

# 2.2.4 MIOS review frequency  

(1) The MIOS should be reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis (once every two years), unless determined otherwise by the Minister. This review will be known as a major version update. (Note: The latest approved version of MIOS will remain in effect until it is superseded)   
(2) Due to the rapid advancement of technology and associated proliferation of standards, it may be necessary to review parts of the MIOS from time to time to incorporate such advancements and changes of IS/ICT in government and industry. This review will be known as the minor version update.  

# 2.3 STANDARDS CERTIFICATION  

# 2.3.1 Standards Certification Responsibilities  

(1) Standards Certification is a process that verifies whether an e-Government system complies with the standards that are contained in MIOS. The responsibility to certify that e-Government systems comply with the MIOS are governed in terms of the following legislation:  

(a) Public Service Regulations, Chapter 5, Part III, C states: “C.2 A head of department shall include compliance with the MIOS in the project approval procedure for the department. The MIOS shall be used in the audit and review of every project of a department.”   
(b) SITA Act, states: “7(6) The Agency … (b) must certify every acquisition of any information technology goods or services by a department for compliance with those standards.”   
(c) SITA General Regulations, states: “4.3 CERTIFICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GOODS AND SERVICES 4.3.1 The Agency must, …, conduct standard certification in respect of all information technology goods or services, which were acquired by departments before the commencement of these Regulations. … 4.3.3 The Agency must conduct standard certification of information technology goods or services – (a) acquired … by a department from the Agency; … and (b) procured … by a department through the Agency …”  

(2) From the above legislation, the stakeholders and their respective responsibilities regarding standards certification are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>No</td><td>Stakeholder</td><td>Role and Responsibilities</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Head of Department</td><td>The Accounting officer, who must ensure and account/report that all e-Government systems (assets) under his/her control comply with the MIOS.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>SITA</td><td>The Certification Authority, who must certify that all e-Government systems - in acquisition and in operation - comply with MlOS.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td> Supplier / ICT Industry</td><td>Supplier, Provider and/or Integrator of e-Government systems, who must provide evidence that the e-Government system comply with MIOS.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 2.3.2 Certification Process  

(1) All e-Government systems must comply with MIOS. The certification management process implements the necessary controls into the existing Supply Chain Management, Solution Development and Solution Integration processes in order to meet the legislative requirement on interoperability.  

(2) The certification controls are illustrated in Figure 4: MIOS Certification Process and is described in the following table: (Note: The illustration is not intended to describe the requirements management, supply chain, solution development or solution integration processes of government.)

# 3 MINIMUM INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS (MIOS)  

# 3.1 INTRODUCTION  

(1) This section of the MIOS defines the minimum set of open standards that are necessary to achieve the minimum level of interoperability across e-Government systems, and cites the standards development organisations from where these standards can be obtained.  

(2) The list of interoperability standards is divided into two sections: (a) Public Sector Records and Data Standards, which must be used to achieve interoperability (data exchange) among e-Government information systems (IS); and (b) Technical Interoperability Standards, which must be used to achieve the required level of interoperability (i.e. network connectivity, data exchange protocols and interfaces, and uniform data access and presentation) across government ICT infrastructure.  

The following convention is used in the respective standards tables:  

“Ref” $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Unique MIOS Reference Number of the standard.   
“Provider” means the Standards Development Organisation (SDO) who is either the owner or custodian of the interoperability standard as the case may be.   
Text in square brackets $[]$ denotes the Standard Reference Number as allocated by the SDO.   
Text in braces / curly brackets {} denotes a guideline or constraint on the implementation of the standard.
