# Chapter 6 Cybersecurity in South Africa: Towards Best Practices  

Sagwadi Mabunda $\textcircled{1}$  

# 6.1 Introduction  

Cybersecurity in South Africa is a topic that has been on the agenda for a number of years. The government has expressed great concern over the proliferation of cybersecurity risks. It asserts that cybersecurity threats and the combatting thereof have a personal, national and international dimension.1  

South Africa is experiencing the manifestations of the “digital paradox”.2 This is an acknowledgement of the opportunities that technological advances present to the development of the country on the one hand and the threats that are posed by the cybercriminals on the other. Essential services such as water and electricity supply rely heavily on ICT, so too do businesses, organisations and citizens. While ICT applications such as e-government, e-commerce, e-health and e-education are considered enablers of development, they are also vulnerable to the threats that present with the promise of technology particularly, in the form of rampant cybercriminality.3 The digital paradox presents itself in the way that the potential of ICT for development is stifled or threatened by the proliferation of cybercrime and cybersecurity threats.4  

The South African government faces great challenges when it comes to regulating cybersecurity across the whole government structure i.e. at the national, regional and municipal levels. It is burdened with ensuring that there exists the same level of coordination for independent agencies such as regulators, businesses, civil society, households and individuals.5 While there are positive efforts being made, it is clear that much more needs to be done to improve; particularly when it comes to South Africa’s Cybersecurity legislative frameworks.  

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has developed the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) to measure the commitment of countries to cybersecurity at a global level. This index measures countries along five pillars  – (i) legal measures, (ii) technical measures (iii) organisational measures (iv) capacity building and (v) cooperation. These pillars were adopted because cybersecurity has a broad field of application which cuts across various sectors and industries.6 According to the 2018 GCI report, South Africa was determined to be in the 56th place globally. To put that in perspective, when compared to the other BRICS countries it is in the fourth place before Brazil, which sits at 70th position globally, while Russia is 26th, followed by China at 27th and India at 47th. Regionally, South Africa is fourth behind Mauritius, Kenya and Rwanda which hold first, second and third place respectively; it is followed by Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda which hold the fifth, sixth and seventh positions respectively.7  

When considering the South African cybersecurity landscape, the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (NCPF) is the first port of call. The NCPF was developed in line with the Justice Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) Delivery Agreement which is aimed at ensuring that “all people in South Africa are and feel safe”. Output 8, for example, seeks to foster integrated ICT systems that will combat cybercrime.8 National cybersecurity per the NCPF is a broad term that encompasses many aspects of electronic information, data, and media services which affect the economy, security and wellbeing of a country.9 Cybersecurity is defined as “the practice of making the networks that constitute cyberspace secure against intrusions, monitoring confidentiality, availability and integrity of information, detecting intrusions and incidents that occur, and responding to and recovering from them10”. Therefore, the NCPF has identified that the most important policy domains are those that (1) address the reduction of vulnerabilities of cyberspace, (2) prevent cyber threats and attacks in the first instance, and (3) where an attack does occur, ensure the swift recovery and functioning of critical information systems.11  

Cyber threats necessitate a cybersecurity culture which is driven mainly by the State to ensure that citizens are able to take full advantage of the information age whilst remaining conscious of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in ­cyberspace. In other words, the risks associated with ICT must be counterbalanced with its role in the functioning of modern and open societies.12 As South Africa ventures into exploring the Fourth Industrial Revolution,13 an acute awareness of this balancing exercise is paramount. Achieving overall national cybersecurity is no small feat; the government must ensure that the policies and regulations adopted do not take a myopic view, rather they should address the challenges particular to South Africa while keeping in mind its international obligations. While the NCPF may not be able to address every aspect of cybersecurity, it does pronounce on the critical areas such as data protection and privacy, cybercrime, interception of communication, and cyberdefence.  

# 6.2 Data Protection  

South Africa holds the right to privacy in very high esteem owing to the gross violations witnessed during the Apartheid regime. There is both a common law right to privacy14 and a Constitutional right to privacy provided for in section 14.15  

Data protection is regulated by the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) which was passed in 2013. POPIA, which is closely modelled after an early draft of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), seeks to regulate (amongst other things) the processing of personal data, setting obligations for the data processors and controllers and enabling data subjects to bring civil actions against entities (both public and private) who violate their individual rights.16 POPIA was the result of thorough research done by the South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC) which based the principles of the Act on the principles implemented by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union.17 It is also substantially similar to the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act (DPA). Those that have studied both Acts have noted that one can anticipate the impact that POPI will have in South Africa by investigating the impact that the DPA has had in the UK.18  

Section 39 of POPIA establishes the Information Regulator as an independent juristic person for the purpose of enforcing POPIA. The appointment of members of the Information Regulator was approved by the National Assembly on 7 September 2016. Some of the responsibilities that it is tasked with are education, monitoring, compliance enforcement, complaint management, research and international cooperation. Since the Act was promulgated in 2013, its entering into force has been done over stages. In June 2020, yhe Presidency announced that  a few further ­provisions will come into force from 1 July 2020. These sections (2 to 38, 55 to 109, 111 and 114(1), (2) and (3)) are essential to the functioning of the Act as they relate to conditions for the lawful processing of ordinary and special personal informationand; codes of conduct for the Information Regulator and the regulation of direct marketing by means of unsolicited electronic communication to name a few. Entities in the form of both private and public bodies have been given a 1 year grace period to ensure that they are compliant with the Act. POPIA will operate fully from 1 July 2021.19  

It has become well established that the exponential advancements in technology have increased the capabilities of companies and other organisations to gather, store, process and disseminate personal data as people inadvertently leave a digital footprint through their mobile phones and computers.20  

It is anticipated that once POPI comes into full effect, it will have a significant impact on the ways that companies gather, save, utilise and distribute personal information. A 2014 study done by IQ business in conjunction with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) predicted that in addition to civil and criminal liability that can attach to non-compliant companies, the possible reputational damage that can occur could be severely detrimental to the company’s future.21  

Greenleaf argues that the key to effective data privacy law is in the adoption of a comprehensive set of data privacy principles which accord with international standards such as the OECD guidelines as well as having mandatory legal enforcement mechanisms in place.22 Furthermore, data privacy laws should cover most of the country’s private and public sectors in other words, they should not place their focus on a few subsectors such as “credit reporting” or “health23”.  

Greenleaf identifies ten principles which are at the core of data privacy and should be included in privacy legislation. These are: “(1) fair data collection, (2) data quality, (3) purpose specification, (4) purpose notification when data are collected, (5) limitation to specified data uses, (6) reasonable security safeguards, (7) openness, (8) access and correction of an individual’s data, (9) accountability of the responsible parties and (10) implementation or instruction of data export restrictions”.24  

POPI encompasses nine out of ten of these principles. Condition 1 deals with the principle of accountability of the data controller to implement and monitor adherence to the conditions of POPI. Condition 2 provides for the collection of private data which may only be done in a manner which is fair, lawful and within the knowledge and consent of the data subject. Condition 3 provides for the purpose specification which states that data must be collected for a specific use as well as requiring that the purpose be specified at the time of collection. Condition 3 also provides for the purpose and rights notification where the data subject must be notified that her data is being collected and what it will be used for. Condition 4 prohibits the excessive collection of personal data i.e. personal data may only be used or processed for the purpose that it was originally collected for. Condition 5 provides for the quality of data which must be accurate and relevant. Condition 7 provides for reasonable security safeguards which state that the necessary technical and procedural practices should be implemented so as to ensure the safety of personal data. Condition 8 provides the right of data subjects to know what information on them is stored and processed by the data controller. The data controller has the responsibility in that regard to affect any corrections the data subject may inform them of. Finally, chapter 9, section 72 provides for data export restrictions which states that cross-border data transfers may only be done to countries that have adequate data privacy legislation in place.25  

These principles, properly applied, inform the implementation of the Act and ensure that it will be an effective law. While comparisons can be made with the UK DPA, the similarities should not be overstated because ultimately, the unique South African context will determine how successful the quest for data privacy it.  

# 6.3 Consumer Protection  

The South African National Consumer Protection Act $(\mathrm{CPA})^{26}$ seeks “to promote a fair, accessible and sustainable marketplace for consumer products and services … [and] to prohibit certain unfair marketing and business practices”.27 The Act does not have specifically formulated provisions that directly address cybersecurity issues. This is a missed opportunity considering today’s increasingly digitized society.  

One of the areas that the CPA could provide guidance on is with regard to the ‘right to be forgotten’. On the back of the European Court of Justice judgment of Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González28 the question becomes whether customers of multinational corporations such as Google can enforce that right in South Africa. Without pronouncing on the desirability or practicality of the right to be forgotten, South Africa would be an interesting case study given its strong privacy, access to information, and consumer protection values.  

The right to be forgotten is typically spoken of in the context of the right to privacy.29 The South African Constitution recognises the right to privacy as a fundamental right enshrined in the Bill of Rights and so it is encapsulated in all other rights. This is contemplated by section 39(2) of the Constitution which provides that “[w]hen interpreting any legislation … every court, tribunal or forum must promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.” This means that when interpreting the consumer rights provided for in the CPA, due regard must be given to the right to privacy.  

Currently, the CPA is limited as it only recognises the right to privacy when it comes to restrictions on unwanted direct marketing.30 It may be argued that when a consumer uses the services of a supplier, she should have the right to have her personal information erased from the supplier’s databases upon termination of their transactional relationship, subject, of course, to other legal obligations the supplier may have.31 Unfortunately, this proposition is currently only theoretical as it has not yet played out in the courts, but one can postulate that a court would be in favour of finding that a consumer does have a right to be forgotten, particularly given that the CPA recognise a consumer’s right to be heard and obtain redress.32  

# 6.4 Cybercrime  

It is important to stress that Africa was the last continent to embrace ICTs, and a decade ago only a handful of African countries had local Internet access.33 There has been since a significant growth in the adoption of ICTs across sub-Saharan Africa. However, this occurred in the context of inadequate telecommunication infrastructures.34  

The endless possibilities created by Internet connectivity for millions across the continent have created also unlimited capabilities for those tied to the criminal world. Those who wish to engage in criminal activities have taken full advantage of the internet’s power to commit a host of cybercrimes.35 However, expanding bandwidth and increases in the use of wireless technologies and infrastructures have been coupled with high levels of computer illiteracy and insufficient or ineffective regulatory measures, making African countries especially vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches.36  

South Africa is no stranger to cybercrime attacks and the NCPF reinforces the need to take progressive steps to combat it. It notes a need to promote, guide and coordinate activities that would be aimed at improving cybersecurity measures which include the fight against cybercrime. These measures include ensuring that the collection of intelligence is strengthened and the state’s capacity to investigate, prosecute and combat cybercrime (amongst other threats) is improved.37  

Parliament has been working on passing South African Cybercrimes legislation since 2015. The first attempt at a draft bill was unsuccessful as it appeared to have tried to do too much  as it  sought to regulate  both cybercrime and cyberdefence issues. It was overly broad and practically unenforceable. The bill consequently saw two major revisions to become the Cybercrimes Bill that was recently passed in both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. At the time of writing, it is awaiting the President’s signature for it to be passed into law.  

# 6.5 Interception of Communications  

Interception of communication is a core pillar of the preservation of national public order in South Africa and is regulated by the Regulation of Interception of Communication and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act (RICA). RICA was enacted in 2002 to address what was understood to be the nature of the telecommunications environment at that time. This environment has evolved significantly 17 years on.  

It is stated in the preamble that the purpose of the Act is to regulate the interception of certain communications and other communication-related information. It also seeks to regulate the processes of application for, issuing of and directions authorizing interception of communications. Furthermore, it establishes interception centres; the Office for Interception Centres and the Internet Service Providers Assistance Fund. Its goal is also to protect the privacy of communications subject to certain exceptions in the case of serious crimes or threats to national security.  

One of the features of RICA is that an electronic communication service provider who provides a mobile cellular electronic communications services is prohibited from activating a SIM card on its electronic communication system unless it has recorded and stored (at its own cost) the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Service digital Network Number (MSISDN-number) of the SIM card against the details of the customer along with their full name, identity number and at least one address.38 This information becomes essential when it comes to the need for security forces to intercept communication. A controversial issue which played out in Court, as explained in the following section.  

# 6.5.1 Amabhungane v Minister of State Security  

On the 16th of September 2019, the High Court of South Africa Gauteng Division, Pretoria delivered a judgment per Sutherland J in the case of Amabhungane and Others v The Minister of State Security and Others39 which declared parts of RICA unconstitutional. The declaration of invalidity was suspended for 2 years to allow the legislature to remedy the defects of the Act.  

The High Court found that there were several examples of abuse of RICA by the respondents which included undisputed first-hand experience of investigative journalist Sam Sole and Advocate Down, a State Prosecutor, of being spied upon. Furthermore, it stated that Mr. Sole has no right under RICA to demand disclosure because it forbids him from being informed. His efforts to obtain details about the spying were met with a contemptuous response and unsubstantiated allegations that no irregularities have occurred.40 Although the Respondents claimed that because RICA was undergoing some developmental changes, the challenge was abstract and not based on a set of fact, the Court found that the irregularities noted above alone were good enough reason to hear the matter.  

The controversy that shrouded RICA was centred around the question of what effect the authorisation of interceptions has on the rights conferred by the Constitution, namely the section 14 privacy rights, section 16(1) freedom of ­expression rights, section 34 access to court rights and section 35(5) fair trial rights.41 While it is common cause that RICA and bulk interceptions practice is an intrusion on privacy rights, the controversial issue was whether the infringement could be justified in terms of section 36 and section 39 of the Constitution.42  

Section 16(1) Freedom of expression Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes(a)	freedom of the press and other media; (b)	freedom to receive or impart information or ideas; (c)	freedom of artistic creativity; and, (d)	academic freedom and freedom of scientific research.  

Section 34 Access to courts  

Everyone has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before a court or, where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum.  

Section 35(5) Right to a fair trial  

Evidence obtained in a manner that violates any right in the Bill of Rights must be excluded if the admission of that evidence would render the trial unfair or otherwise be detrimental to the administration of justice.  

42 The Constitutional provisions are –  

Section 36. Limitation of rights  

1.	 The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom, taking into account all relevant factors, including –.  

(a)	the nature of the right;   
(b)	the importance of the purpose of the limitation;   
(c)	the nature and extent of the limitation;   
(d)	the relation between the limitation and its purpose; and, (e)	less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.  

2.	 Except as provided in subsection (1) or in any other provision of the Constitution no law may limit any right entrenched in the Bill of Rights.  

Section 39 Interpretation of Bill of Rights 1.	 When interpreting the Bill of Rights, a court, tribunal or forum –-  

(a)	must promote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom;   
(b)	must consider international law; and,   
(c)	may consider foreign law.  

2.	 When interpreting any legislation, and when developing the common law or customary law, every court, tribunal or forum must promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights. 3.	 The Bill of Rights does not deny the existence of any other rights or freedoms that are  

Two discrete issues were raised.  

1.	 The first was a challenge to the constitutionality of parts of RICA. The statute permits the interception of communications of any person by authorised state officials subject to the conditions prescribed in the Act.   
2.	 The second was whether there exists lawful authority for the admitted practice of the State in conducting ‘bulk interceptions’ of telecommunication traffic. The National Strategic Intelligence Act 30 of 1994 and the Intelligence Services Control Act 40 of 1990 were implicated in this issue.43 For the sake of brevity, this second issue will not be discussed here.  

The Court considered the first challenge with reference to the following considerations:  

(a)	 The Act does not afford a right of notice to a person who has been surveilled of such surveillance.  

The Court held that once it is assumed that secret surveillance is justifiable, the controversy presents when one considers the possibility of abuse by overzealous or corrupt officials. Without the right to notice, a subject of surveillance whose privacy has been wrongly violated has no recourse for relief in the courts. This means that her right to access to court as contemplated in section 34 of the Constitution would have been compromised, for without a right, there can be no remedy.44  

The challenge supposed that the purposes of RICA could be achieved without a total ban on post-surveillance disclosure whereas the Respondents stood firm on the need for a total ban. The High Court, after considering foreign legal precedence,45 embraced the right to post-surveillance notice as a facet of a democratic social order, subject to the safeguards against undoing the very objective of legitimate surveillance.46 It found that there is no reason in the South African condition to deny such a right.47  

The Court found that RICA, including sections 16(7), 17(6), 18(3)(a), 19(6), 20(6) and 22(7), is inconsistent with the Constitution and accordingly invalid to the extent that it fails to prescribe a procedure for notifying the subject of the interception. In an interim order, the Court read into sections 16(11) and (12) the right to notification.48  

(b)	 The model of safeguards in respect of the selection of the designated judges is deficient.  

Section 16 of RICA provides for the procedure that must be followed for application for, and issuing of, directions and entry warrants to a designated judge. Section 16(4)–(7) stipulates the duties of a designated judge.49  

The safeguard model was criticised by the applicants in two respects; the first was that the independence of the designated judge is compromised by the selection process and the de facto unlimited duration of appointment, and second, that the absence of an adversarial process may compromise the efficacy of the judicial role.50  

The Applicants sought an interim order which read into the definition of a designated judge that she should be appointed by the Judicial Services Commission for a non-renewable term of 2  years. The Court held that such an order would not be appropriate in the interim. It held that the Minister should continue to appoint the designated judge but that she or he should be nominated by the Chief Justice and the Minister should be obliged to accept the nomination. The appointment should be for a non-renewable term of 2 years.51  

The second part of the challenge was the absence of a prescribed procedure for the proper evaluation of the evidence placed before the designated judge in keeping with the adversarial tradition of the South African judicial system. This, it was argued, implicates the section 34 rights to a fair hearing and excludes audi alteram partem. The applicants argued for the introduction of a public advocate to play the role of devil’s advocate, something which is not a default position in South Africa. This would allow the designated judge to have the benefit of hearing the matter ventilated by two opposing parties so she can apply her mind to the final decision fully.52  

The Court found that RICA is inconsistent with the Constitution in as far as it fails to provide a system for appropriate safeguards to deal with ex parte orders. It held, however, that there are a number of considerations that must be factored in when determining what the appropriate safeguards should be, therefore, it elected to leave that to Parliament. The declaration of invalidity is suspended for 2 years.53 (c)	 The model of safeguards concerning custody and management of information gathered by surveillance is deficient.  

RICA provides for two types of interception of communication; the first is realtime interception, and the second, is trawling through past data. Telecommunications service providers are obliged to retain all data in terms of section 30(2) of RICA, between a minimum of three and a maximum of 5 years at their own discretion.  

The applicants argued that the minimum three-year period is too long for service providers to archive data because that period is not reasonably connected to a legitimate objective of RICA. Other jurisdictions prescribe, at most, a two-year period. Secondly, having accessed and stored these data in servers at Interception Centres, the regulations on how those data are used and managed, i.e. stored and transferred, are unsatisfactory.54  

The Court, while recognising other jurisdictions, held that there is no injustice done to the limitations enquiry by recognising that there may be disagreements what may be deemed as a reasonable period length. It held that while a period of 5 years may seem excessive when emphasis is given to comparative jurisdictions; it is not inconsistent with section 36 of the Constitution.55  

However, on the second issue, the Court held that RICA, especially section 35 and 37, are inconsistent with the Constitution and accordingly invalid for 2 years (to allow Parliament to cure the defect) to the extent that the statute itself fails to prescribe proper procedures to be followed when state officials are examining, copying, sharing, sorting through, using, destroying and/or storing the data obtained from interceptions. The model of safeguards in RICA are not effective in (i) preserving legal privilege in respect of lawyers and their clients and (ii) preserving the confidentiality of sources of investigative journalists.56  

It was uncontested that both lawyers and journalists have obligations to preserve confidential information. The issue, however, is whether their confidential exchanges, either in absolute or in relative terms, ought to be protected. It is also accepted that the right to privacy is not absolute, but the question remains whether interception impacts on their professional roles and the efficacy with which those roles are performed.57  

The Court distinguished between the role of a lawyer and that of a journalist and dealt with each discreetly. It held that the conditions and restrictions imposed by the Act are the appropriate mechanisms to manage intrusions on lawyers.58 With regard to journalists, the Court held that the absence of express provisions which instruct the designated judge to examine the justifications presented to her for spying on journalists is evidence of the failure of RICA to align with section 16 of the Constitution, which makes RICA unconstitutional.59  

Overall, this case highlights the difficulties that present with the interception of communications. The Courts have to balance competing interests carefully with a perfect understanding of the impact that each will have. This was a very complex case which the Court dealt with skilfully and tellingly illustrates the pivotal role that the Courts play, as there will always be tensions between the rights of citizens and the obligations of the State with regard to cybersecurity. All judgments which declare a piece of legislation in part or in whole to be unconstitutional need to be confirmed by the Constitutional Court. The matter was heard in February 2020 and at the time of writing, judgment was still reserved.  

# 6.6 Cyberdefence  

At the South African level, the Department of Defence and Military Veterans has been given the overall responsibility for coordination, accountability, and implementation of cyberdefence measures as an integral part of its National Defence mandate. The first draft of the Cybercrimes Bill [B-2015] was called the Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill. Subsequent drafts of the Bill did away with the cybersecurity section of the Bill, electing to limit the scope of the Bill to Cybercrimes so as to not encumber it with too much. The drafters decided it would be better to enact a separate Cybersecurity Bill which would deal with issues pertaining to cyberdefence and cyberwarfare. This has not yet been done.  

As of 2016, a cyberwarfare strategy was said to be in the advanced stages of development, having been submitted to the Chief of the South African National Defence Force.60 It was earmarked for approval and partial implementation in the 2018/2019 fiscal year.61 The cyberdefence strategy seeks to ensure the military’s readiness to continue operating at an optimal level should it come under a cyberattack of any kind. It should also have the capability and capacity to not only launch conventional attacks, but also cyber-attacks.62  

The cybersecurity strategy must ensure national security and elevate efforts for protecting critical information infrastructure. These efforts must be on par with traditional defence interests.63 While the NCPF is the overarching cybersecurity strategy, and although this is not prescribed by the law, it may need to be updated as more research is conducted about South Africa’s vulnerabilities to cyberwarfare, for instance.  

Sutherland remarks that the Department of Defence offers very little indication of possible threats that may exist or where they would be likely to originate from.  

Therefore, it is arguable whether cyberwarfare is even a real threat to South Africa that would necessitate a cyberwarfare strategy or dedicated cyberdefence legislation. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that there may be some States which may wish to attack South Africa with the aim of destabilising its government, although this is somewhat unlikely.64 Even if a majority of the cyber-attacks that South Africa could experience might not emanate from hostile nations, a cyberdefence and cyberwarfare strategy is nevertheless essential should the need arise someday.  

# 6.7 Cybersecurity Best Practices  

The NCPF urges civil society, government and the private sector to play their part in fostering a cybersecurity culture inter alia, implementing cybersecurity awareness programmes; supporting outreach to civil society, children and individual users; updating and reviewing existing privacy regimes; and so forth.65  

The Cybersecurity $\mathrm{Hub^{66}}$ is a key feature of the NCPF. It has been created to conduct cybersecurity audits, assessments and readiness exercises. It is also responsible for providing best practices guidance on ICT security for Government, business and civil society, as well as initiate cybersecurity awareness campaigns.67 Additionally, it seeks to facilitate the creation of additional sector-specific Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that will, in addition to conducting sector cybersecurity audits, assessments and readiness exercises, provide best practice guidance on ICT security.68  

In 2017, the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS), through the Cybersecurity Hub, engaged in a nationwide survey that sought to gather information about the cybersecurity readiness of South African organisations. It reported on the dearth of reliable data in South Africa from organisations both in the private and public sectors and found that where there is data available, much of it is anecdotal.69  

The aim of that survey was to gather information about the status of cybersecurity plans in organisations, identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities, determine the capability of organisations to respond to and recover from cybersecurity-related attacks and to survey the status of cybersecurity governance in organisations.70  

The report identified that the top three challenges that the organisations face were insufficient skills, lack of in-house skills and lack of awareness. It also ­identified that of the organisations surveyed, only $45\%$ belonged to CSIRT and only $22\%$ of them were obliged to report incidents. Furthermore, only $25\%$ of the surveyed respondents reported that they had threat intelligence capabilities, whereas, $20\%$ indicated that this was in development.71 The report did note, however, that there appears to be a decrease in the number of incidents that have been reported between 2016 and 2017 by $47\%$ . Furthermore, $29\%$ of the organisations indicated that they had fully functioning cybersecurity plans while $37\%$ of them indicated that they had discussed a cybersecurity plan which they would implement in the future.72  

A majority of the respondents interviewed in the cybersecurity readiness survey indicated that they align to international standards73 such as to the International Organisation for Standards (ISO) 27001 family of standards.74 A third aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology $(\mathrm{NIST})^{75}$ and SANS  Institute standards.76  

It is worth mentioning that the banking industry in South Africa appears to be the one with more progressive regulations when it comes to cybersecurity.77 Data protection is of particular interest. The South African Reserve Bank’s Prudential Authority has issued a number of directives that outline the measures that banks need to adopt or implement so as to ensure compliance with domestic and international obligations.  

One of the directives issued by the Prudential Authority was the directive on cloud computing and offshoring of data78 which was issued in terms of section 6(6)  

of the Banks $\mathrm{Act}^{79}$ to all banks, controlling companies, branches of foreign institutions and auditors of banks or controlling companies (collectively referred to as banks).  

The aim of the directive is to clarify the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) policy and regulatory stance on cloud computing and offshoring of data. Banks are increasingly extending their use of cloud computing to more significant activities such as offshoring their data through an insourcing relationship with a parent company, for example.80 To this end, banks are expected to follow a risk-based approach when implementing cloud computing and/or offshoring of data. Banks are encouraged to consider of critical importance their risk, risk appetite, due diligence, compliance, ensuring the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of their systems. They must also have contingency plans and measures to ensure that intellectual property and contractual rights are not compromised.  

Some of the best practices identified by the DTPS in the cybersecurity readiness report include the following:  

# 6.7.1 Membership in a CSIRT  

Membership in a sector CSIRT is essential for developing a good cybersecurity culture within organisations. CSIRTs that are dedicated to a particular sector or industry can play an integral role in information gathering particular to that sector and coordinate response efforts. Cooperation between organisations, networking and sharing of incident information enhances organisations’ capabilities when it comes to correcting weaknesses.81  

Creating a CSIRT level obligation to reporting of cybersecurity incidents is essential. In many cases, many organisations shy away from reporting cybersecurity breaches because of a fear of losing public trust. This is unhelpful because it creates an environment where a threat is able to thrive from one organisation to the other, whereas, if it had been reported immediately, other organisations in the sector would have been warned and given an opportunity to proactively protect themselves.  

# 6.7.2 Cybersecurity Awareness Training  

There is immense value in creating a proactive cybersecurity culture as opposed to one that is constantly reactive. A constant challenge faced by South African industries is an overall lack of awareness about the kinds of threats that exist. When asked whether organisations provide cybersecurity awareness training, $57\%$ stated that they do, while $29\%$ were not certain.82  

It is common for the cybersecurity awareness responsibilities to be shouldered by the IT department for example, even though networks, systems and devices in organisations are typically interconnected resulting in the weaknesses in one department negatively affecting another.  

# 6.7.3 Upskilling of Staff  

Cybersecurity training must not end with awareness training. It is necessary for employees to be up-skilled consistently. In this regard, it might be necessary to either outsource training programmes or to enrol employees in organisation-funded cybersecurity awareness and capacity building courses, and certifications which will ensure that they are prepared and up to date with the latest trends in cybersecurity. The cybersecurity readiness survey revealed that $61\%$ of the organisations surveyed had in-house training whereas $8\%$ used external vendors and $4\%$ used affiliated organisations. $10\%$ provided no training at all.83  

Organisations must acknowledge the different skill levels that employees have and provide targeted training which meets their needs. In this perspective, $27\%$ of the organisations reported that they offered beginner training, $25\%$ offered hybrid training, $19\%$ offered intermediate training and only $5\%$ offered advanced training.84  

# 6.7.4  Identifying Threat Actors and Targets  

It is difficult to adopt a comprehensive cybersecurity policy without a clear picture of the kinds of threats and threat actors that exist. Given that many organisations may not have big enough budgets to dedicate to comprehensive cybersecurity policies, it is even more important to prioritise how funds are allocated. It would be counterproductive, for example, for an organisation to dedicate $60\%$ of its cybersecurity budget to creating a comprehensive strategy to defend against cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism when its greatest threat actors are its employees who may steal data for fraudulent purposes.  

For any organisation to have effective response mechanisms to cybersecurity, it must know the kinds of threats and threat actors that it must contend with. The cybersecurity readiness report revealed that the majority of threat actors in South  

African organisations are employees85 $(69\%)$ and criminals $(64\%)$ . Other cybersecurity threat actors were contractors $(41\%)$ , lone hackers $(40\%)$ and hacktivist groups $(39\%)$ .86  

It was clearly shown in the cybersecurity readiness report that employees pose a bigger threat to an organisation than external actors because they tend to be more difficult to detect and they are hard to defend against because they already have legitimate access to systems and networks.  

# 6.7.5 Incident Response  

Incident response is defined as “an organisation’s ability to deal with a situation in which company infrastructure and technology is being attacked and requires action to limit the damage, cost and effects of the incident”.87 A majority of the respondents $(64\%)$ indicated that their organisations were in a position to respond to threats whereas $23\%$ were uncertain of their capacity.88  

When implementing an incident response strategy, organisations must determine how quickly they can recover after a serious incident or disaster. They need to determine the amount of downtime they can ‘afford’, how quickly they can recover and how much money they can lose. Thereafter, they must take the necessary measures to offset those risks.  

# 6.7.6 Frequent Risk Assessments  

One of the best ways to ensure up-to-standard incident responses is to have frequent risk assessments. Risk assessment studies are useful to help an organisation identify whether the cybersecurity controls that it has implemented are appropriate to deal with certain cybersecurity risks.89  

The cybersecurity readiness report showed that just over one-third of organisations $(36\%)$ carry out annual risk assessments, whereas $20\%$ are doing a risk assessment more than once a year. It also showed that $14\%$ of the organisations were uncertain of when risk assessments are undertaken and $4\%$ of the organisations do not do formal risk assessments at all.90  

The frequency of the risk assessment will depend on the particular needs of the organisation. The frequency of the risk assessments will also be in line with the risk appetite that the organisation has. For example, financial institutions may need to conduct risk assessments more frequently than a research institute would. Membership to a sector CSIRT may also influence the frequency with which risk assessments are conducted as organisations may be subject to certain prescribed industry norms and standards.  

# 6.8 Conclusion  

What can be observed from this discussion is that in order for any cybersecurity strategy to be effective, it must be created with a holistic view in mind, it needs to be a deliberate and well-intentioned exercise regardless of whether it is on a national or organisational level. Both the government and individual organisations need to understand that effective cybersecurity strategies cannot and should not be implemented piecemeal. Those creating the strategies need to instil a culture of collective responsibility.  

Governments and organisations must be encouraged to think about cybersecurity in a way that transcends their individual needs. They must act with a global perspective that is cognisant of their international rights and obligations. This means that measures such as intelligence gathering and information sharing must be seen as a collective responsibility that is mutually beneficial. Citizens and customers may also be more inclined to trust them if they admit security breaches and share their experiences with others in an effort to foster greater resistance to cybersecurity threats.  

South Africa still has a long road ahead of it when it comes to comprehensive and effective cybersecurity measures, but it is on the right track. Although there is a great dearth of empirical research on its cybersecurity readiness, there is an awareness of the problem and a need to address it expeditiously. South Africa is known for having good legislation and policies on many issues, such as the Cybercrimes Bill and POPI, however, its greatest challenge is always implementation. It is up to the public and private sectors to work together to and take collective responsibility for fostering a constructive cybersecurity culture.

•	 Scope  

29.  What national laws (or other type of normative acts) regulate consumer protection? Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002. National Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008.  

30.  Is the country a party of any international consumer protection agreement? No.  

# 31.  To whom do consumer protection laws apply?  

Chapter VII of the ECTA makes provision for consumer protection. Section 42 sets out the scope of of application. It applies mostly to suppliers of consumer goods and services as well as to the consumers.  

32.  Do the laws apply to foreign entities that do not have physical presence in the country?  

Section 47 of the ECTA provides that “the protection provided to consumers in this Chapter, applies irrespective of the legal system applicable to the agreement in question.”  

Section 5(8) provides that the provisions in the CPA apply to a matter irrespective of whether the supplier resides or has principal office within or outside the Republic.  

•	 Definitions  

# 33.  How is consumer protection defined?  

It is not defined in the ECTA.   
The term consumer protection is not defined.  

# 34.  How are consumers defined?  

“consumer” means any natural person who enters or intends entering into an electronic transaction with a supplier as the end user of the goods or services offered by that supplier; “consumer”, in respect of any particular goods or services, means:  

(a)	 a person to whom those particular goods or services are marketed in the ordinary course of the supplier’s business;   
(b)	 a person who has entered into a transaction with a supplier in the ordinary course of the supplier’s business, unless the transaction is exempt from the application of this Act by section 5(2) or in terms of section 5(3);   
(c)	 if the context so requires or permits, a user of those particular goods or a recipient or beneficiary of those particular services, irrespective of whether that user, recipient or beneficiary was a party to a transaction concerning the supply of those particular goods or services; and   
(d)	 a franchisee in terms of a franchise agreement, to the extent applicable in terms of section 5(6)(b) to (e);  

# 35.  How are providers and producers defined?  

“certification service provider” means a person providing an authentication product or service in the form of a digital certificate attached to, incorporated in or logically associated with a data message;  

“producer”, with respect to any particular goods, means a person who:  

(a)	 grows, nurtures, harvests, mines, generates, refines, creates, manufactures or otherwise produces the goods within the Republic, or causes any of those things to be done, with the intention of making them available for supply in the ordinary course of business; or   
(b)	 by applying a personal or business name, trademark, trade description or other visual representation on or in relation to the goods, has created or established a reasonable expectation that the person is a person contemplated in paragraph (a); “importer”, with respect to any particular goods, means a person who brings those goods, or causes them to be brought, from outside the Republic into the Republic, with the intention of making them available for supply in the ordinary course of business; “distributor”, in relation to any particular goods, means a person who, in the ordinary course of business— (a) is supplied with those goods by a producer, importer or other distributor; and (b) in turn, supplies those goods to either another distributor or to a retailer; There are no provisions specific to consumer protection in the definition. The CPA applies to all transactions therefore it would be understood that the rights enjoyed in the ‘terrestrial’ sphere would be enjoyed in the digital sphere.  

# 36.  Does the law provide any specific definitions with regards to consumer protection in the digital sphere?  

The focus of the provision is to protect consumers in the case of electronic transactions regardless of whether the goods or services sold or bought online.  

There are no provisions specific to consumer protection in the definition. The CPA applies to all transactions therefore it would be understood that the rights enjoyed in the ‘terrestrial’ sphere would be enjoyed in the digital sphere.  

Rights  

37.  Is the consumer protection law based on fundamental rights (defined in Constitutional law or International binding documents)?  

The ECTA has not specified any fundamental rights.  

The preamble of the CPA provides that it seeks to redress the injustices of Apartheid by developing and employing innovative means to:  

(a)	 fulfil the rights of historically disadvantaged people and to promote their full participation as consumers;   
(b)	 protect the interests of all consumers, ensure accessible, transparent and efficient redress for consumers who are subjected to abuse or exploitation in the marketplace; and   
(c)	 to give effect to internationally recognised customer rights;  

38.  What are the rights of the consumer defined by the law with reference to digital good and services?  

The ECTA makes provisions for goods and services purchased through electronic transactions.  

Section 43(2)  

The consumer has the right to review the entire electronic transaction; to correct any mistakes; to withdraw from the transaction, before finally placing any order.  

Section 43(3)  

If the consumer does not provide the consumer with the information provided for in section 43(1) and the opportunity provided for in section 43(2), the consumer has the right to cancel the right to cancel the transaction within 14 days of receiving the good or services under the transaction.  

# Section 44(1)  

It provides that a consumer is entitled to a cooling off period which means that he or she has the right to cancel without reason and without penalty any transaction and any related credit agreement for the supply of goods or services within seven days of conclusion of the agreement.  

The consumer is also entitled to a full refund within 30 days of cancellation if the consumer made the payment before he or she could exercise the right of a cooling off period.  

However, these rights do not apply to electronic transactions specified in section 42.  

The CPA does not have specific provisions for digital goods and services therefore it is understood that all the rights that are afforded in the terrestrial sphere will be afforded to digital services.  

Chapter 2: Fundamental Consumer Rights  

Part A: Right of equality in consumer market Part B: Consumer’s right to privacy Part C: Consumer’s right to choose Part D: Right to disclosure and information Part E: Right to fair and responsible marketing  

Part F: Right to fair and honest dealing   
Part G: Right to fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions   
Part H: Right to fair value, good quality and safety   
Part I: Supplier’s accountability to consumers  

39.  Is consumer protection law applicable to users of zero price service i.e.  free of charges?  

ECTA does not provided for this.  

The CPA speaks of free goods and services only within the context of “promotional offers”  

“promotional offer” means an offer or promise, expressed in any manner, of any prize, reward, gift, free good or service, price reduction or concession, enhancement of quantity or quality of goods or services, irrespective of whether or not acceptance of the offer is conditional on the offeree entering into any other transaction.  

# •	 Obligations and Sanctions  

40.  Does the law establish specific security requirements to provide digital services or goods?  

ECTA does not have specific security requirements but it does oblige the supplier to provide certain information provided for in section 43.  

The CPA does not have specific provisions for digital goods and services therefore it is understood that all the rights that are afforded in the terrestrial sphere will be afforded to digital services.  

41.  What are the sanctions and remedies foreseen by the law for complying with the obligations? Penalties Section 111 provided for in terms of the CPA.  

(1)	 Any person convicted of an offence in terms of this Act is liable: (a) in the case of a contravention of section 107 (1), to a fine or to imprisonment   
for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and imprisonment; or (b) in any other case, to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12   
months, or to both a fine and imprisonment.  

(2)	 Despite anything to the contrary contained in any other law, a Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction to impose any penalty provided for in subsection (1).  

Administrative fines Section 112  

(1)	 The Tribunal may impose an administrative fine in respect of prohibited or required conduct.   
(2)	 An administrative fine imposed in terms of this Act may not exceed the greater of: (a) $10\%$ of the respondent’s annual turnover during the preceding financial year; or (b)	 R1 000 000.  

(3)	 When determining an appropriate administrative fine, the Tribunal must consider the following factors:  

(a)	 The nature, duration, gravity and extent of the contravention;   
(b)	 any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention;   
(c)	 the behaviour of the respondent;   
(d)	 the market circumstances in which the contravention took place;   
(e)	 the level of profit derived from the contravention;   
(f)	 the degree to which the respondent has co-operated with the Commission and the Tribunal; and   
(g)	 whether the respondent has previously been found in contravention of this Act.  

(4)	 For the purpose of this section, the annual turnover of a supplier at the time when an administrative fine is assessed, is the total income of that supplier during the immediately preceding year, as determined in the prescribed manner.  

(5)	 A fine payable in terms of this section must be paid into the National Revenue Fund referred to in section 213 of the Constitution.  

# • Actors  

42.  What bodies are responsible for the implementation of the consumer protection law?  

ECTA does not provide for specific bodies but the CPA does.  

Chapter 5: National Consumer Protection Institutions   
Part B   
Establishment of National Consumer Commission   
Part C   
Functions of Commission
