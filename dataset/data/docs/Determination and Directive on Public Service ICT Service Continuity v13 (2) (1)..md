# 1. INTRODUCTION  

1.1. The effect of the current pandemic has had unimaginable disruption on organizations and businesses globally.   
1.2. In addition to disruption, the pandemic also presented numerous lessons upon which all stakeholders, including the public service, can learn. For instance, arrangements for alternative workspaces in disruptions proved inadequate as all organizations were affected. This included organizations whose business is the provision of alternative workspaces during disruptions as such environments had to close as well.   
1.3. Organizations that were ill-prepared for the business disruption were impacted more adversely than those with concrete and implementable plans for continuity of their businesses during disruptions, even within a single sector.   
1.4. Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) emphasizes the importance of understanding the organization's needs and the necessity for establishing business continuity management policy and objectives, implementing and operating controls and measures for managing an organization's overall capability to manage disruptive incidents, monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the BCMS, and continual improvement based on objective measurement (ISO 22301; 2012).  

1.5. A BCMS consists of the following components:  

a) Business Management Policy (inclusive of ICT Service Continuity Issues);   
b) people with defined responsibilities;   
c) management processes relating to 1) policy, 2) planning, 3) implementation and operation, 4) performance assessment, 5) management review; and 6) improvement;   
d) documentation providing auditable evidence; and   
e) any business continuity management processes relevant to the organizatio (ISO 22301; 2012).  

1.6. Business Continuity Management (BCM), as part of the BCMS, is an integral part of a holistic risk management process that safeguards the interests of an organization's key stakeholders, reputation, brand, and value-creating activities through:  

i. identifying potential threats that may cause adverse impacts on an organization's business operations and associated risks ii. providing a framework for building resilience for business operations;  

iii. providing capabilities, facilities, processes, action task lists, etc., for effective responses to disasters and failures (ISO 247620: 2008).  

1.7 Consequently, BCM is the entire organization's responsibility, which the enterprise risk management function must lead.  

1.8 When planning for business continuity, the alternative arrangements for information processing and communication facilities (ICT service continuity) are essential for ensuring information, communication technology, and service availability during a disaster and serve as part of the base for the disaster recovery of activities going forward. Such fall back arrangements may include third parties in reciprocal agreements or commercial subscription services.  

1.9 Despite the critical role played particularly by the information and communication technology (ICT) during the pandemic, the ability of this capability to maintain and salvage organizational operations during and after disruptions is proportional to the amount of planning that has been embarked upon preparation for such eventuality.  

1.10 Furthermore, ICT service continuity planning is squarely dependent on a functional BCMS of the organization. Departments must understand that any ICT service continuity arrangements in the absence of a fully functional BCMS might not yield the desired outcomes.  

1.11 Consequently, this determination and directive, therefore, assume that departments already have Business Continuity Plans (BCP) as per the provisions of the Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology Policy Framework (CGICTPF). The BCP must, amongst other things, identify and or cover minimum critical services that shall continue to be provided by a department even during a disaster. In line with this, the determination and directive focus on information and communication technology fallback arrangements for departments during a disaster.  

# 2. PURPOSE  

2.1. The purpose of this Determination and Directive is to provide clear guidance to departments for the development and implementation of ICT service continuity plans in support of the Department's Business Continuity objectives.   
2.2. The above is done to ensure the continued availability of ICT systems and services during the disruption and the ability to recover quickly upon being impacted by the disaster.  

# 3. AUTHORIZATION  

The Minister for Public Service and Administration (MPSA) issues this Determination and Directive in terms of section 3(2), read with sections 3(1)(f), and (g) of the Public Service Act, 1994.

# 7. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION  

This Determination and Directive shall come into effect on the date of signature by the MPSA.  

# 8.1CURRENT MINIMUM ICT REQUIREMENTS  

8.1.1 The Head of Department must establish an ICT Disaster Recovery Team for the department. The ICT Disaster Recovery Team led by the GITO will develop, document, and execute processes for a department's data recovery f of business continuity, and IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster/ ICT service / ICT system disruption.   
8.1.2 Guided by the risk appetite and tolerance of the department, the ICT Disaster Recovery Team must define and agree on what would constitute as an ICT disaster.   
8.1.3 The Head of Department, through the office of the GITO must identify all departmental Information Systems / ICT Services supporting both internal operations and service delivery to the public, customers, and stakeholders.   
8.1.4 The Head of Department must determine the impact of Business Impact Analysis (BIA) on the department and the public/customers/stakeholders should each of the identified information systems / ICT Services, referred to in paragraph 8.1.3, not be provided due to disruption/disaster.   
8.1.5 The Head of Department must determine the system availability/capacity requirements of the department informed by the BIA or their criticality.   
8.1.6 The Head of Department must ensure that redundancy/continuity arrangements are in place and informed by the department's system availability/capacity requirements.
