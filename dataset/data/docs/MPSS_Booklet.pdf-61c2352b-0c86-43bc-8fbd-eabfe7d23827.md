GOVERNMENT SECURITYREGULATOR(GSR)  

MINIMUM PHYSICALSECURITY STANDARDS(MPSS)  

# FOREWORD:  

MINIMUM PHYSICAL SECURITY STANDARDS (MPSS) 2009  

Government ultimately is responsible for ensuring both the ‘freedom and security of the person as stated in Section 12 of the Constitution.  In doing so, government must take cognisance of a variety of factors and ensure the existence of relevant legislation.The South African Police Service therefor is mandated by the Constitution and secure lives of SA citizens and property.  

In 2000 Cabinet further enhanced the role of SAPS and specifically/explicitly mandated us to regulate physical security in the government, parastatals as well as National Key Points. In response to this, the SAPS formed the Division: Protection and Security Services (PSS) to focus on all security and protection functions.  PSS is now the cornerstone in coordinating and supports the implementation of physical security standard and administration of the National Key Points Act 103 of 1980.  PSS is a catalyst to synchronize the provision of physical security, regulate security within Government sector and National Key Points and harness the multi disciplinary approach in order to align all physical security operations to the legislative framework.  

The South African Police Service has through a consultation process with the affected stakeholders, compiled: Minimum Physical Security Standards for implementation by all organs of state.  The Minimum Physical Security Standards provide guidance on the required minimum levels of physical security.  Also, provided herewith is annexures designed to provide guidelines on the different types of installations and security requirements.  

Whilst the minimum are not legally enforceable, they are necessary.  Furthermore minimum standards are a starting point towards regulations which will be enforceable and binding.  Minimum standards therefor are import in ensuring that institutions are able to properly gear themselves for compliance once the regulations have been promulgated.  

The Minimum Physical Security Standards are some cornerstones of our security, when implemented, they will represent a solid first line of defence. The attached annexures will be reviewed annually, it is expected that minor changes will be effected to ensure that they are in line with existing security developments.  

The Minimum Physical Security Standards will be reviewed every five years to ensure that they remain consistent with our security measures.  

The Minimum Physical Security Standards are promulgated by the National Commissioner of the South Africa Police Service for implementation within the Government Sector, Parastatals and National Key Points. Security is an operational responsibility of every institution. Institutions must continuously conduct vulnerability and security risk assessment in order to mount equivalent protection and security.  Furthermore, government departments as well as municipalities are also required to continue to take important steps that will identify risks and assure the protection of municipal buildings.  

I wish to thank all the stakeholders that provided inputs when the Minimum Physical Security Standards were compiled as well as the Government Sector Security Council who consolidated and ratified the final standard.  

I urge all organs of state all Security Managers to use these standards and also to participate in the processes set to review the Minimum Physical Security Standards.

ACTING NATIONAL COMMISSIONER: SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE SERVICE DEPUTY NATIONAL COMMISSIONER  

# EDITORIAL:  

# PREFACE  

In 2000 Cabinet enhanced the role of SAPS and specifically/explicitly mandated Protection & Security Services to regulate physical security in the government, parastatals as well as National Key Points. It was our approach to first develop the Minimum Physical Security Standards to be promulgated by the National Commissioner of the South African Police for implementation within Government Sector, Parastatals and National Key Points.  

Government Security Regulator has through a consultation process with the affected stakeholders compiled Minimum Physical Security Standards to provide guidance on the required minimum levels of physical security. Also reference here is made to researched annexures designed to provide guidelines on the different types of installations and security requirements. The annexures will be reviewed annually and the Minimum Physical Security Standards every five years. The annexures will be available on request and any other information on the annexures can be directed to SAS@saps.org.za Tel: 012 400 6054 Fax 012 400 7053. As the chairperson of the Government Sector Security Council, I wish to extend our gratitude to the council for the work and assistance to ensure the final approval of the MPSS.  

In the course of 2003, the South African Cabinet approved the mandated functions and broad structure of the new Protection and Security Services Division of the SAPS. These functions led to the establishment of the Component: Government Security Regulator (GSR) component. The GSR functions will be to regulate the service of all existent and newly identified Strategic Installations and the administration of the National Key Points Act.  

The Government Security Regulator will perform these functions at national and provincial departments (excluding NIA, SASS and the SANDF), Public Entities, Parastatals and private entities which are classified as National Key Points.  

The Government Security Regulator (GSR) was mandated to  compile and implement the Minimum Physical Security Standards (MPSS) as an official document on minimum physical security standards, which must be maintained at all departments / institutions.  

Any comments and/or recommendations in respect of this standard should be forwarded in writing to the Chairperson of the Government Sector Security Council (GSSC). All the representatives to the GSSC are responsible for ensuring that the document and feedback is received from all of their cluster members.
