# 1. INTRODUCTION  

1.1. Rapid advancements in information and communication technology have made it difficult for Government departments to keep up and or sustain investment in this area. This has further ensured that the required and appropriate skills remain concentrated outside departments and or the public sector in general.  

1.2. Cloud computing services can provide government departments with access to ondemand ICT hardware and software resources over the Internet. These include ICT resources, such as computing power, data storage capacity, software services and operating system functionality. These resources run on computer servers, storage devices, and networking equipment located in physical data centers operated by a cloud service provider (CSP). The service provider is responsible for the security, maintenance, and backup of the hardware, software, and data stored in these facilities, freeing up the department to focus on its core service delivery functions.  

1.3. The economic efficiencies, privacy and information security concerns, environmental impact (carbon emissions) issues associated with technological practices as well as the general opportunities associated with technological developments particularly in the area of cloud computing services have further prompted the issuing of this determination and directive.  

# 2. PURPOSE  

2.1. The purpose of this Determination and Directive is to provide clear guidance on the adoption and use of cloud computing services in the public service.

# 9. PROVISIONS ON THE USAGE OF CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES  

There are numerous provisions to be considered by departments before, during, and after acquiring cloud-based computing services. The following points outline the provisions:  

# 9.1. WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?  

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal  

management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of three service models and four deployment models.  

![](images/e40ea96362346f4c5d2e198b7de44b3a0554c0faf70decd741a8e85d67d6253c.jpg)  
Figure 1. Cloud Deployment Models adapted from NIST  

# Cloud Service Models  

Software as a Service (SaaS): The capability provided to a department is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible through a web browser (e.g. Gmail). The department does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities.  

Platform as a Service (PaaS):  Departments develop applications using the Cloud Service provider’s hosted hardware and software platforms. The department does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.  

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  The capability provided to the department is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the department is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The department does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).  

# 9.2. GENERAL CLOUD CONSIDERATIONS  

9.2.1. The Head of Department must ensure that Cloud Services are the first option explored before any on-premise infrastructure investment is made. This option must be fit for purpose, and preference (not exclusive use) must be given to private government cloud where the capability exists.   
9.2.2. The Head of Department must ensure that the proposed cloud-based computing services and/or solutions are fit-for-purpose and appropriate for the delivery of the respective department processes. This must be applied to all cloud services, whether long-term or short-term, and care should be taken to only procure services when they are ready to be consumed to avoid fruitless and wasteful expenditure.   
9.2.3. The Head of Department must ensure that the proper procurement processes concerning the procurement of ICT goods and services/Cloud are followed.   
9.2.4. The Head of Department must ensure that scaling up of cloud services is based on operational requirements, rather than purchasing upfront and not utilizing until the operational need arises.  

# 9.3. BEFORE ACQUIRING AND IMPLEMENTING CLOUD SERVICES  

9.3.1. The Head of Department must ensure that all data is classified according to the classification system prescribed in the Minimum Information Security Standards (MISS).  

9.3.2. The Head of Department must, as far as practically possible, avoid moving data classified as “Secret" or “Top Secret”, to the Public, Hybrid or Community Clouds.  

9.3.3. The Head of Department must as far as practically possible, ensure that data that is intended for general public consumption, such as data hosted on Departmental public-facing websites, is moved to a Public Cloud.  

9.3.4. The Head of Department must ensure that data always resides within the borders of South Africa. Where such is not practically possible, the Head of Departments must ensure that provisions of section 72 of the POPI Act are complied with.

9.3.5. The Head of Department is accountable for managing the risks to the Department even concerning services provided by service providers/contractors.  

9.3.6. The Head of Department must ensure that a comprehensive  

![](images/e5cfc21db194aba126b5cf6fa088976b49aca95876be43cf6c7867a59f578554.jpg)  

Risk assessment is undertaken for each cloud service that the Department intends to utilise. The details of the risk assessment must be captured in the relevant business case and presented to the Department Risk Committee.  

9.3.7. The Head of Department must ensure that a Cloud Readiness Assessment is conducted before the decision is made to move to cloud-based computing services. The Cloud Readiness Assessment Checklist (Appendix A) can be used to guide departments.  

9.3.8. The Head of Department must ensure that a Business Case is developed. The Business Case must include at a minimum:  

a) The scope of the Cloud Services required;   
b) The budget over the short, medium and long term;   
c) A calculation of the Total Cost of Ownership over the medium and long term;   
d) The Human resource skills required to support the cloud services environment;   
e) The infrastructure required to enable the proper operation of the cloud service (Broadband connectivity etc);   
f) The intended benefit to the department through the use of the cloud service.   
g) The detailed outcome of the Risk Assessment, a summary of the key risks, and the recommendations for mitigation.  

9.3.9. The Head of Department must ensure that the Business Case is approved before the Cloud Services are consumed,  and reviewed at regular intervals.  

9.3.10. The Head of Department must ensure that a valid contract exists between the Department and the CSP before utilising a cloud service.  

![](images/fb4efcc3bc8dea1b1b06fb6f2cc210d08c40e76d29c40551f1abb2c78733b7d0.jpg)  

9.3.11. At a minimum the contract must:  

a) Explicitly state that the department is the owner of all rights, title, and interest in the data and that all data will be maintained, backed up and secured until returned on termination of the agreement (unless other provisions are made for the migration, transfer or destruction of the data).   
b) State that data processing (mining) shall be carried out in a manner provided for by the POPI Act and shall be authorized by the Department.   
c) Identify the actual geographic locations where data storage and processing will occur.   
d) Confirm the jurisdiction which governs the operation of the contract.   
e) Confine data storage and processing to specified locations where the regulatory framework and technical infrastructure allow the department to maintain adequate control over the data.   
f) Make provisions for the safe return/transfer of data should the cloud service provider be the subject of a takeover.   
g) Specify what will happen to the data, applications, infrastructure, etc., (e.g. transfer to a new provider, returned to the department, permanently deleted) once the Contract ends.   
h) Define contract provisions relating to the migration of data on termination of the contract (i.e. CSP takes full responsibility for data migration and or who plays what role during data migration).  

9.3.12. The Head of Department may enter into a medium-term contract (that is, contract period of more than 3 years but less than 5 years) for cloud services. The Head of Department must ensure that such a medium-term contract makes provisions for early termination and must agree at the time of contracting on the method of calculation for damages, should damages be applicable. In the event that a Department has entered into a medium-term contract but wishes to terminate such a contract prior to its expiry date, the Head of Department must ensure that there are no damages for early termination payable by the Department or ensure that it is aware of any potential damages that may flow for early termination.  

# 9.4. DURING  CLOUD SERVICE CONSUMPTION  

9.4.1. The Head of Department must ensure the security of the data in line with the existing departmental information security policy.   
9.4.2. The Head of Department must ensure that access rights to data stored or processed in the Cloud are regularly reviewed.   
9.4.3. Cloud Service Subscription levels can be scalable up or down according to demand, resulting in variable costs. The Head of Department must ensure that officials are not able to scale up cloud services without proper authorisation.   
9.4.4. The Head of Department must ensure that an inventory of Assets (Data or applications) is developed and maintained during the contract period.   
9.4.5. The Head of Department must ensure that the department’s Business Continuity plans are updated following the implementation of the cloud service and ensure that the department conducts regular business continuity testing.   
9.4.6. The Head of Department must ensure that mechanisms exist to backup departmental data. Backups of data must be regularly reviewed to ensure that the risk of data loss is minimised.  

# 9.5. CLOUD SERVICE TERMINATION  

9.5.1. At the termination of the agreement with a CSP, the Head of Department must ensure that all data and/or applications that belong to the Department are transferred to a new provider, returned to the department and/or permanently deleted.  

# 9.6. GENERAL

# APPENDIX A – CLOUD READINESS ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST  

Moving your IT systems to the Cloud offers many benefits including reduced costs, flexibility, increased efficiency, and in many cases, better performance and security. SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS all present several key differences in terms of security, performance, reliability, and management. This guide will help you assess your readiness to transition to cloud computing and identify any areas that need to be re-evaluated.  

After reading through these checklists and determining your department’s current cloud computing readiness, you’ll have the tools you need to start preparing for your transition.  

# 1. WILL MY DEPARTMENT BENEFIT FROM TRANSITIONING SERVICES TO THE CLOUD?  

Although most departments will benefit from transitioning some or all of their IT services into the Cloud, not all will. Start with these questions to help determine whether your department should transition to cloud computing.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>What is your department's current IT infrastructure expenditure?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is Cloud computing likely to reduce costs?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>How much does usage fluctuate over time?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Would your department benefit from a more elastic solution?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does your department need to add applications or functionality but cannot make a large capital expenditure for additional IT infrastructure?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Table 1   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Is your IT department able to effectively provide maintenance and security, and maximise efficiency for your IT infrastructure?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will your department benefit strategically or financialy from a reduction in IT focus?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does your department have a BCM (Business Continuity Management Planning (BCM)) in place?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does your department need to secure sensitive data on proprietary servers?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will the increased accessibility of the Cloud improve your company's performance?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Use these questions to get a brief overview of your company’s current Cloud Computing readiness and to identify areas that need to be addressed.  

Table 2   


<html><body><table><tr><td>What is the extent of your department's current IT usage?</td></tr><tr><td>How quickly would you like to transition to the Cloud?</td></tr><tr><td>Have you prepared a cost-benefit analysis?</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have a team capable of managing the transition?</td></tr><tr><td>Have you classified your data?</td></tr><tr><td>Are you prepared to transition data securely?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Do you plan to use laaS, PaaS, or SaaS? Will the increased accessibility of the Cloud improve your department's performance?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Security is a key concern in using Cloud Computing technology. This checklist will help you identify key considerations for safely transitioning and securing data.  

# Outlining the security plan  

Table 3   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Have you made an outline of your top security goals and concerns?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>What types of assets will be managed by the system?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Have key assets been listed and rated based on their sensitivity?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>How assets are currently managed and how will this change when transitioned to the Cloud?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Has the right cloud delivery model been assigned based on the assets' sensitivity?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Has the network topology been mapped?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Enumerating safeguards and vulnerabilities  

Table 4   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Have the security controls been enumerated, verified, and evaluated?</td></tr><tr><td>Will all sensitive data stored in the Cloud be encrypted?</td></tr><tr><td>Are remote connections to the Cloud properly encrypted?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Have you evaluated the security risk of the server's physical location?</td></tr><tr><td>Are the servers housed in guarded and locked rooms?</td></tr><tr><td>Have all vulnerabilities been identified and addressed? Are staff properly trained on the new security protocols?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Complying with regulations  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Have you reviewed your cloud service provider's security policies?</td></tr><tr><td>Do they comply with POPl Act, PAlA, ECT Act or other regulations your data may be subject to?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Have you drafted any contracts or agreements with your cloud service provider to bridge compliance gaps?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 5  

# 2. PERSONNEL CONSIDERATIONS  

A department’s staff must be properly prepared for the cloud computing transition to ensure that it does not interfere negatively with day-to-day operations. Use these questions to make sure your team is ready.  

# Preparing your cloud adoption team  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Who will be heading the effort to move systems to the Cloud?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Has a team been assembled to plan and execute cloud adoption?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Who are the key human resource assets for the plan?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is management in full support of the adoption strategy?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Do you need to bring on additional staff or consultants to help adopt Cloud computing technology?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# 3. LOCATION CONSIDERATIONS  

Moving to cloud computing means your servers will be physically located in another place.   
This can have ramifications for your IT infrastructure’s speed, security and reliability.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Where is the cloud service provider located?</td></tr><tr><td>Is the location near your user base (customers or staff)?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will speed be adversely affected by the server's location?</td></tr><tr><td>Can you visit the data centre where your Cloud will be hosted?</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 4. RELIABILITY  

Ensuring the reliability of your IT infrastructure is a critical step in transitioning to cloud computing. Make sure the Cloud will be as reliable as in-house IT infrastructure by going through the following checklist.  

# Assessing the cloud provider’s reliability  

Table 10   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Does your cloud service provider have a reputation for reliability?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>How long have they been operational?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>What is their average uptime over the past three years?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Do they have a reliability guarantee?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Do they use reliability safeguards like backup power sources and redundant servers?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will they promptly inform you of any planned or unplanned outages?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is the cloud service provider regularly assessed by a third-party auditor?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does the cloud provider offer comprehensive support?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will your in-house IT team be responsible for support?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Making a continuity plan  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Do you have a backup system if the Cloud goes down for any reason?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is there a contingency plan to continue mission-critical functions if the Cloud cannot be accessed?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will you store copies of your data in-house?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is your data safe-harbored with a third party who can protect against data loss?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# 5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS  

One of the primary concerns when moving to the Cloud is how it will affect performance. In many cases speed can be improved when using cloud computing solutions. Answer the following questions to make sure your performance is not adversely affected by a transition to the Cloud.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Is the cloud provider's hardware sufficient to handle your workload?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will you be using the public or private Cloud?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will you be using dedicated hardware?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>What steps will the cloud provider take to ensure consistent performance?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does the cloud provider make any performance guarantees?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Will the cloud solution offer the same or better performance compared to an in-house solution?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# 6. FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  

Most departments can save considerably when moving systems and applications into the Cloud. Use this checklist to help you consider the total financial impact of the move.  

# Cloud provider fees  

<html><body><table><tr><td>What are the initial set-up fees?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>How complex is the pricing model? Is it transparent?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Can the provider increase fees at regular intervals?</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Table 13  

# Migration costs  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Will there be additional human resource costs associated with the transition?</td></tr><tr><td>Will there be additional hardware costs associated with the transition?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>What will be the cost of an outage during migration?</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 7. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  

Although often overlooked, legal considerations are extremely important when moving to the Cloud. Use this checklist to make sure the transition is made legally.  

# Understanding the legal agreement with your cloud provider  

Table 16   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Have you read the cloud provider's standard contract and or Service level agreement (SLA)?</td></tr><tr><td>How does the contract affect your data's property rights?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Do you have the full legal rights to the data you will be moving to the Cloud?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Is the cloud provider's privacy policy compatible with your department's?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Does the cloud provider have the right to access your data?</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>If hosted in another country, which law applies to you?</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Complying with regulations  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Is your data subject to any government regulations?</td></tr><tr><td>Does the cloud provider comply with those regulations?</td></tr><tr><td>Who is legally responsible for your data's security?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Are you able to audit your cloud provider's compliance with regulations?</td></tr></table></body></html>
