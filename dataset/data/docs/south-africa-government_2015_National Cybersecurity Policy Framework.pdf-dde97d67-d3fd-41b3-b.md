# EXECUTIVESUMMARY  

1. Information and Communications Technologies (lCTs) are indispensable in modern society.The interconnectivity of computer networks contributes significantly to economic growth, education, citizens' participation in social media and many others.   
2. This new electronic environment is commonly known as cyberspace. The dependence of the daily functioning of society on information communication technology solutions has led to a concomitant need for the development of adequate security measures. This is because the danger that Cybersecurity threats pose, is real.   
3.The numerous cyber-attacks launched in recent years against advanced information societies aimed at undermining the functioning of public and private sector information systems have placed the abuse of cyberspace high on the list of international and also local security threats. Given the seriousness of cyber threats and of the interests at stake, it is therefore imperative that the comprehensive use of information communication technology solutions be supported by a high level of security measures and be embedded in a broad and sophisticated Cybersecurity culture. For this reason, the cyber threats need to be addressed at both the global and national levels.   
4. National Cybersecurity is a broad term encompassing the many aspects of electronic information, data and media services that affect a country's security, economy and welbeing. Ensuring the security of a country's cyberspace therefore comprises a range of activities at different levels.   
5.World-wide Cybersecurity strategies are being developed and are aimed at setting policy goals, measures and institutional responsibilities in a succinct manner. Generally, the primary concern is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability (C-I-A) of computer data and systems and to protect against or prevent intentional and non-intentional incidents and attacks. Priority is also given to critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP).   
6. These strategies normally also contain measures against or reference to cybercrime. Measures against cybercrime provide a criminal justice response to C-l-A attacks against computers and thus complement technical and procedural Cybersecurity responses. However, cybercrime comprises also offences committed by means of computer data and systems, ranging from the sexual exploitation of children to fraud, hate speech, intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements and many other offences. Furthermore, any crime may involve electronic evidence in one way or the other. While this may not be labelled “cybercrime", a cybercrime strategy would nevertheless need to ensure that the forensic capabilities be created that are necessary to analyse electronic  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITYPOLICYFRAMEWORKFORSOUTHAFRICA  

evidence in relation to any crime, or that all law enforcement officers, prosecutors and judges are provided at least with basic skills in this respect.[1]  

7.This South African National Cybersecurity PolicyFramework is aligned to these goals and is necessitated to ensure a focussed and an all-embracing safety and security response in respect of the Cybersecurity environment and establishes and addresses the following:  

a) The development and implementation of a Government led, coherent and integrated Cybersecurity approach to address Cybersecurity threats;   
b) Establishing a dedicated policy, strategy and decision making body to be known as the JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee,to identify and prioritise areas of intervention and focussed attention regarding Cybersecurity related threats. The Cybersecurity Response Committee will be chaired by the State Security Agency (SSA) and will be supported operationally by a Cybersecurity Centresituated at the SSA   
c) The capability to effectively coordinate departmental resources in the achievement of common Cybersecurity safety and security objectives (including the planning， response coordination and monitoring and evaluation);   
d) Fighting cybercrime effectively through the promotion of coordinated approaches and planning and the creation of required staffing and infrastructure;   
e) Coordination of the promotion of Cybersecurity measures by all role players (State, public, private sector, and civil society and special interest groups) in relation to Cybersecurity threats, through interaction with and in conjunction with the Cybersecurity Hub (to be established within the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services);   
f) Strengthening of intelligence collection, investigation, prosecution and judicial processes, in respect of preventing and addressing cybercrime, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare;   
g) Ensuring of the protection of national critical information infrastructure;  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITYPOLICYFRAMEWORKFORSOUTHAFRICA  

h) The promotion of a Cybersecurity culture and compliance with minimum security standards;   
i) The establishment of public-private partnerships for national and action plans in line with the NCPF; and   
j) Ensuring a comprehensive legal framework governing cyberspace.  

8. The National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (NCPF) is aligned with and dealt within the JCPS Cluster's mandate and obligations under Outcome $_{3:}$ All people are and feel safe in South Africa. In this regard, Output 8 of Outcome 3 requires the development and implementation of a Cybersecurity policy and the development of capacity to combat and investigate cybercrime that seeks to promote thefollowing  

a) Measures to address national security threats in terms of cyberspace;   
b) Measures to promote the combating of cybercrime;   
c) Measures to build confidence and trust in the secure use of ICT; and   
d) The development, review and update of existing substantive and procedural laws to ensure alignment.  

9.The NCPF is intended to provide a holistic approach pertaining to the promotion of Cybersecurity measures by all role players and will be supported by a National Cybersecurity Implementation Plan which will be developed by the JCPS Cluster in consultation with relevant stakeholders, identifying roles and responsibilities, timeframes, specific performance indicators, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The development and large-scale implementation of a system of security measures as implemented elsewhere in the world will form part of the National Cybersecurity Implementation Plan.

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR SOUTH AFRICA  

operandi are constantly evolving and is included here as typical examples of Cybersecurity / cybercrime threats that many people will encounter when using computers and information communication technology. Phishing is typically carried out by e-mail or instant messaging and it often directs users to enterdetails at a fakewebsitewhose look andfeelare almost identical to the legitimate one.  

# 1. Introduction  

1.1 A number of strategic interventions and tactical interventions have been successfully implemented over the past few years and other interventions are in the process of being implemented within the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) Cluster in the fight against crime with the objective of making South Africa Safe. As part of Government's Outcome based priorities, the JCPS Cluster signed on 24 October 2010, the JCPS Delivery Agreement, relating to Outcome 3: “All People in South Africa Are and Feel Safe". This Outcome focuses on certain areas and activities, clustered around specific Outputs,where interventions will make a substantial and a positive impact on the safety of the people of South Africa. One such area relates to Output 8: which requires the development and implementation of a Cybersecurity Policy and the development of capacity to combat and investigate cybercrime. In line herewith, this document therefore sets out a National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (NCPF) for South Africa.  

1.2 It is generally accepted that Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) have become indispensable in modern society. The increased interconnectivity of computer networks and the expansion of broadband including mobility are contributing significantly to economic growth, digital integration, education, electronic governance, citizens' participation in governance and many others. This new electronic environment is commonly known as cyberspace. It has created a “global village” with instantaneous communication possible between persons on the opposite sides of the world. The NCPF Policy Framework therefore recognises that Cybersecurity threats and the combating thereof have a personal, national and international context.  

1.3Cyberspace comes with new types of challenges to the governments of the world and it therefore introduces a further dimension to National Security. It is a borderless platform that enables more sophisticated threats such as cybercrime, cyber terrorism, cyber war and cyber espionage. The numerous cyber-attacks launched in recent years against advanced information societies aimed at undermining the functioning of public and private sector information systems have placed the abuse of cyberspace high on the list of security threats. The acknowledgment that such attacks pose a threat to international security reached new heights in 2007 owing to the first-ever co-ordinated cyber-attack against an entire country and also because of large-scale cyber-attacks against information systems in many other countries as well. The co-ordinated cyber-attacks against government agencies, banks,  

# NATIONALCYBERSECURITY POLICYFRAMEWORKFOR SOUTHAFRICA  

media and telecommunications companies in Estonia demonstrated the vulnerability of a society's information infrastructure as an aspect of national security that needs attention in all countries. There are views that Internet is becoming more and more militarized.The problem is very specific to malware being distributed through terror groups.  

1.4The recurrence and growing incidence of cyber-attacks indicate the start of a new era in which the security of cyberspace requires a global dimension and the protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure must be elevated, in terms of national security, on par with traditional defence interests.  

1.5National Cybersecurity is a broad term encompassing many aspects of electronic information, data, and media services that affect a country's security, economy and welbeing. Ensuring the security of a country's cyberspace thus comprises of a range of activities at different levels.Towards this end, the most important policy domains include reducing the vulnerability of cyberspace, preventing cyber threats and attacks in the first instance and,in the event of an attack, ensuring a swift recovery of the functioning of critical information systems.  

1.6 Thus, a Cybersecurity strategy must appraise the vulnerability of a country's critical information infrastructure, devise a system of preventative measures against cyber-attacks, and decide upon the alocation of tasks relating to Cybersecurity management at the national level. Moreover, it is also important to improve the legal framework against cyber-attacks, to enhance international and institutional co-operation, and to raise public awareness and develop training and research programmes on Cybersecurity.  

1.7 The above threats necessitate a comprehensive and all-encompassing approach in dealing with cyber threats.In short, a Cybersecurity culture, driven in main by the State, is critical to ensure that citizens take advantage of the information age, whilst remaining conscious of the threats and vulnerabilities of cyberspace. The NCPF recognises the need to balance, on the one hand, the risks associated with the use of information systems and, on the other hand, the indispensability of extensive and free use of information technology to the functioning of open and modern societies. The growing threats to Cybersecurity should not hinder the crucial role of information and communications technology in stimulating the growth of economies and societies.  

1.8In response to the above challenges, Governments worldwide have established policies and structures that govern interaction and collaboration between Government, private sector, academia and civil society in an effort to prevent, react to, combat and mitigate Cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.  

1.9 The NCPF recognises that the State is charged with implementing a Government led, coherent and integrated Cybersecurity approach which, amongst others,will:  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICYFRAMEWORK FOR SOUTHAFRICA  

a) Promote a Cybersecurity culture and demand compliance with minimum security standards;   
b) Strengthen intelligence collection, investigation, prosecution and judicial processes, in respect of preventing and addressing cybercrime,cyber terrorism and cyber warfare and other cyber ills;   
c) Establish public-private partnerships for national and international action plans;   
d) Ensure the protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure; and   
e) Promote and ensure a comprehensive legal framework governing cyberspace.  

1.10 This framework is intended to implement an allencompassing approach pertaining to allthe role players (State, public, private sector, civil society and special interest groups) in relation to Cybersecurity. This framework will be supported by a National Cybersecurity Implementation Plan which will be developed by the SSA in consultation with relevant stakeholders, identifying roles and responsibilities, timeframes, specific performance indicators, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  

# 2. The South African Context  

2.1 South Africa like many other countries has become dependent on the Internet to govern, to conduct business and for other social purposes. The Internet has become indispensable to many South Africans and will continue to be, as more people access the information highway. Taking into consideration the increase in national and international bandwidth in South Africa, cybercrimes and threats are and will continue to increase. These cybercrimes and threats have the potential to impact on our national security and economy.  

2.2 Currently there are various pieces of legislation, some with overlapping mandates administered by different Government Departments and whose implementation is not coordinated. Furthermore, the legislation when viewed collectively does not adequately address South Africa's Cybersecurity challenges.  

2.3 The absence of an aligned legal and regulatory framework, and the challenge of uncoordinated Cybersecurity eforts is not unique to South Africa, other jurisdictions arefaced with the same challenges.  

2.4Statistics in 2011 indicate that South Africa was in the top three countries that are targeted for phishing purposes, the other countries are the USA and the UK. In addition to phishing, other e-Crime incidents in the RSA have increased to the value of millions of rands. The banking sector is especially vulnerable to cybercrime. In light of the above and many more unreported incidents, there is a need to combat cybercrime.  

2.5 The borderless nature of cybercrimes introduces a further dimension to National Security. Numerous cyber-attacks have been launched against a number of countries,such as the attack on Estonia in 2007, which crippled the country's electronic systems. South Africa is not immune to such atacks. The protection of South Africa's critical information infrastructure and the coordination thereof is therefore essential. South Africa needs to develop mechanisms that will ensure proactive and coordinated national response to cyber threats and incidents including combating cybercrime. The Government's leadership role in this regard is important, whilst acknowledging that Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility, public sector, private sector and civil society.  

2.6 The role of the ICTs in social and economic development of a country has been widely acknowledged; however the full potential of ICTs cannot be realized unless there is confidence and trust in the secure use of ICTs. Government should take responsibility to ensure that theprivate sector and civil society are not only aware of the dangers of operating in cyberspace but also take necessary measures not to become victims of cybercrime. It is thus prudent to develop within South Africa a culture of Cybersecurity that will address the needs of the public sector, private sector and civil society.  

2.7 Opportunities of ICT and the challenges of Cybersecurity are fuelled by advances in technology. Consequently, there is a need to develop the requisite skills to exploit the opportunities of an information economy and meet the dynamic challenges of Cybersecurity. South Africa will always lag behind or be vulnerableunless we develop requisite skills. There is a need to create an enabling environment for Cybersecurity training, education,research and development and skills development programmes in South Africa.  

2.8 South Africa is a consumer of ICTs and depends on overseas manufactured technologies to secure its cyberspace.The downside of this, is that our critical information infrastructure will continue to have some degree of vulnerability. Thus it is important to develop indigenous Cybersecurity technologies. Unless we develop Research and Development capabilities to address this, we will continue to rely of foreign technologies for this purpose. The absence of stringent compliance monitoring to ensure that technologies used comply to international and national Cybersecurity standards.  

2.9 South Africa will in the promotion and development of Cybersecurity measures in relation to this NCPF bear in mind the international instruments and measures that may be relevant such  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITYPOLICYFRAMEWORKFORSOUTHAFRICA  

as the work of the various agencies of the United Nations.° In 2011, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to help secure cyberspace for consumers, businesses, and children and to mitigate the risks posed by cybercrime. The MOU will enable the parties to avail the necessary expertise and resources to establish legal measures and legislativeframeworks atnational level,forthebenefit of allinterestedcountries.This initiative is a major milestone in implementing a co-ordinated global approach to an increasingly serious global problem.'  

# 3. Purpose of the NCPF  

3.1The purpose of the NCPF is to create a secure, dependable,reliable and trustworthy cyber environment that facilitates the protection of critical information infrastructure whilst strengthening shared human values and understanding of Cybersecurity in support of national security imperatives and the economy. This will enable the development of an information society which takes into account the fundamental rights of every South African citizen to privacy, security, dignity, access to information, the right to communication and freedom of expression.  

3.2 The NCPF seeks to ensure that Government, business and civil society are able to enjoy the full benefits of a safe and secure cyberspace. To this end, the public sector, private sector and civil society willneed to work together tounderstand and address the risks,reduce the benefits to criminals and seize opportunities in cyberspace to enhance South Africa's overall security and safety including its economic well-being.  

3.3 This NCPF therefore provides for:  

a) Measures to address national security in terms of cyberspace; b) Measures to combat cyber warfare, cybercrime and other cyber ills; c) The development, review and updating existing substantive and procedural laws to ensure alignment; and d) Measures to build confidence and trust in the secure use of ICT.  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY POLICYFRAMEWORKFORSOUTHAFRICA  

# 4. Key Objectives of the NCPF  

4.1The NCPF articulates the overall aim and objectives of the South African Government and sets out strategic priorities that will be pursued to achieve these objectives. In order to achieve the strategic visionset out in thispolicy, it is expected that this National Cybersecurity Policy Framework will:  

4.1.1 Centralise coordination of Cybersecurity activities,by facilitating the establishment of relevant structures, policy frameworks and strategies in support of Cybersecurity in order to combat cybercrime, address national security imperatives and to enhance the information society and knowledge based economy;

4.1.5 Promote a culture of Cybersecurity; and   
4.1.6 Promote compliance with appropriate technical and operational Cybersecurity standards.  

# 5. Capacity to Respond to Cybersecurity lmperatives  

5.1The Justice Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS),working in consultation with other Government Clusters , will oversee the implementation of this policy framework, with the aim to ensure centralized coordination of Cybersecurity issues.  

5.2Adedicated JCPSCybersecurity Response Committee will be established within the JCPS Cluster to coordinate Cybersecurity activities, drive the implementation of the NCPF and manage the implementation of Output 8. The Cybersecurity Response Committee will be chaired by the State Security Agency (SSA) and it will be supported operationally by a CybersecurityCentresituated at the SSA.All relevant JCPS departments willberepresented on the Cybersecurity Response Committee.  

5.3 The role of the JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee will, amongst others, be to:

5.4.9 Provide the Secretariat services required in relation to the JCPS Cybersecurity Committee, and   
5.4.10 Perform any other function consistent with the strategic and policy objectives set out herein.  

# 6. Cybersecurity Hub and Additional CSlRTs  

6.1 Notwithstanding the envisaged JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee, the Cybersecurity Centre and the existing ECS-CSiRT, there is also a need to ensure appropriate consultation between the JCPS cluster departments, the private sector and civil society regarding Cybersecurity matters.   
6.2 To deal with the above stated, this policy recognises that the crucial need for the facilitation of interaction between the key role players in the public sector, private sector and the broader civil society. The NCPF therefore promotes the coordination and consultation between the JCPS cluster departments, the private sector and civil society regarding Cybersecurity matters through the establishment of a Cybersecurity Hub within the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DOC). The Cybersecurity Hub will be operated within the DOC in accordance with national security guidelines and standards issued by the JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee.   
6.3 To enhance interaction, consultations and to promote a coordinated aproach regarding engagements with the private sector and civil society, Cybersecurity Hub will amongst others, have the responsibility to:   
6.3.1 Coordinate general Cybersecurity activities, in consultation with JCPS CRC as well as including identifying stakeholders and developing public-private relationships and collaborating with any sector CSiRTs that may be established;   
6.3.2 Disseminate relevant information to othersector CSiRTs, vendors, technology experts on Cybersecurity developments;   
6.3.3 Provide best practice guidance on ICT security for Government, business and civil society;   
6.3.4 Initiate Cybersecurity awareness campaigns;   
6.3.5 Promote compliance with standards, procedures and policy developed by the JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee regarding Cybersecurity matters with a bearing on national security.   
6.3.6 Encourage and facilitate the development of appropriate additional sector CSiRTs. The sector CSIRTs will:   
6.3.6.1 Be a point of contact for that specific sector on Cybersecurity matters;   
6.3.6.2 Coordinate Cybersecurity incident response activities within that sector;

# 7. Verification of Information Security Products and Systems  

7.1 South Africa needs to independently assess and certify products and systems that are used to process or store information that can have an impact on national security. The NCPF therefore promotes the facilitation by the JCPS Cybersecurity Response Committee and the National Cybersecurity Hub of the development of a National Information Security Verification Framework that will enable the achievement of this objective by executing the following:  

a) Facilitating effective partnerships between the Republic of South Africa and countries with established capacity to perform information security assessments and certifications.   
b) Facilitating effective partnerships between the Government of South Africa, the private sector, academic and research institutions to ensure that there is always capacity to perform information security assessments and certifications within the borders of the Republic.   
c) Developing National regulations for verification of products and systems with applications in Information Security.   
d) Facilitating effective partnerships among government institutions, e.g. those tasked with technical assessments, and those whose responsibility is licensing, and those  

# NATIONAL CYBERSECURITYPOLICY FRAMEWORKFOR SOUTH AFRICA  

who monitor, (e.g. the Auditor General), to ensure that solutions are implemented in accordance with certification conditions and legislation.  

e) Establishing a body that will centrally coordinate the required national verification functions.  

# 8. NCll Protection  

8.1 The NCPF recognises the need to provide a mechanism to ensure that South Africa's critical information infrastructure is protected and secured against cyber related crimes. It is also noted that a more secured critical information infrastructure will help to achieve the continued provision of essential services and support national security, economic prosperity and social well-being of the Republic. The policy framework recognises that a significant proportion of SA's national critical information infrastructure (NCll) is privately owned or operated on a commercial basis.  

8.2 The NCPF therefore seeks to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to ascertain that all National Critical Information Infrastructure (NCll) are identified and properly protected from a variety of threats. For continued availability of the critical information infrastructure, the NCPF thus promotes the development of a National Critical Information Infrastructure (NCIl) Strategy that will address the identification and protection of NCll by:  

a) Developing National Critical Information Infrastructure regulations, relating,inter alia, to:  

i. Information Classification and Information Security Policy and Procedures;   
ii. Third Party Access to NCII;   
1i1. Access to and authentication on NCll;   
iv. Storage and archiving of critical databases;   
V. Incident management and business continuity; and vi. Physical and technical protection of all NCll.  

b) Facilitate an effective business - government partnership relating to the implementation of the Cll Protection Plan. To this end, the private sector, State Owned Enterprises (SOE's), and other government agencies and institutions such as the State Information Technology Agency (SiTA) will play a critical role in ensuring the implementation of NCIl protection plan.  

# 9. Cryptography  

9.1 There are an ever-increasing numbers of cryptographic devices, crypto graphic software and users requiring secure communications and the geographic spread of locations of these devices. The NCPF therefore provides for the regulation of cryptography given the critical role it plays in ensuring improved secure communications.  

9.2 The NCPF notes that various attempts at regulating cryptography were initiated as a way of developing a coherent and integrated approach to this matter. These strategies are found in various laws such as:  

a) National Convention Arms Control Act (Act 41 of 2002)   
b) Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (Act 25 of 2002)   
c) Electronic Communications Security (Pty) Ltd Act (Act 68 of 2002)   
d) Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communications Related Information Act (Act 70 of 2002)   
e) State Information Technology Agency Act (Act 88 of 1998)   
f) Conventional Arms Control Regulations (R7969 of 2004)   
g) Cryptographic regulations (R8418 of 2006)  

9.3Taking into consideration the above-mentioned legislation,the NCPF recognises that there is a need to:  

a) Review the existing legislation and regulations thereof; and b) Develop an integrated regulatory framework for Cryptography for the country.  

# 10.Online E-ldentity Management in Cyberspace  

10.1 It is noted that the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 20o2 (Act 25 of 2002) (ECT Act) provides for the establishment of the South African Accreditation Authority to facilitate the accreditation and regulation of authentication services and products. It further provides for advanced electronic signatures and facilitates the recognition of electronic documents as legal and binding.  

10.2 The NCPF notes that the South African Post Offce (which in terms of the ECT Act, 2002 is a preferred service provider for advanced electronic signatures) has developed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKl) to support advanced electronic signatures (e-identity) and the Department of Public Service and Administration pursuant to its mandate in E--Government willdevelop a  

# NATIONALCYBERSECURITYPOLICYFRAMEWORKFORSOUTHAFRICA  

PKI Strategy. The Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DOC), pursuant to its mandate established the South African Accreditation Authority to accredit and regulate authentication services and products.  

10.3The issue of identity management in cyberspace is central to building confidence and trust in the secure use of ICTs. The NCPF seeks to address the fragmented approach by promoting the development of an integrated National E-identity and PKl strategy. Such a strategy and implementation thereof will be critical inproviding inter alia e-government services as well as to ensure security, confidentiality and integrity. Uptake and usage of e-identity in e government services will stimulate other sectors as well.  

10.4 The NCPF acknowledges that transmission of information over the Internet for trading and communication purposes presents new and sophisticated threats for both the senders and recipients of information. Therefore to ensure online transaction security, the NCPF provides for the development of a holistic National E-ldentity and PKl Strategy. The strategy will, amongst others, assist to address:  

a) Authentication and securing of the identities of the parties to an e-transaction;   
b) Confidentiality, ensuring information is kept private;   
c) Integrity issues, by ensuring the information or process has not been modified or corrupted;   
d) Non-repudiation issues, by ensuring that neither party can refute that the transaction occurred (i.e. the trans action is binding); and   
e) The structure and regulatory framework for E-ldentity and a Public Key Infrastructure.  

10.5 The NCPF also requires that the development of a holistic National E-ldentity and PKI Strategy should be aligned to the broader objectives set out herein and in particular the roles and the responsibilities of the critical stakeholders in the implementation of the NCPF.

The Public-PrivateCivil sector partnership is based on the understanding that Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility and there is a need to leverage on joint knowledge and perspectives, to combat cybercrime.  

11.2.2 The NCPF thus promotes the establishment of collaboration with local stakeholders, with a focus on the following aspects:  

(a) Inclusion of the industry and creating an enabling environment for a successful partnership;   
(b) Encouraging private sector groups to address common security interests and collaborate with government including encouraging cooperation among groups from interdependent industries;   
(c) Bringing private sector and government together in trusted forums; and   
(d) Creating a common understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities that the country faces and the responses required.  

# 11.3 International Cooperation  

11.3.1 Internet as a form of media can in essence not be regulated in total by an authority or government. Given the borderless nature of the Internet and the challenges it poses in terms of jurisdiction, it is important that countries learn and collaborate with each other in order to combat cybercrimes.  

11.3.2 Therefore, international collaboration is critical in securing cyberspaces nationally and globally. Recognising the need for global collaboration on matters regarding Cybersecurity, South Africa is required to collaborate with relevant and appropriate international organisations and governments, in line with the Constitution, national security imperatives, foreign policy and existing international agreements. To this end, South Africa will:
