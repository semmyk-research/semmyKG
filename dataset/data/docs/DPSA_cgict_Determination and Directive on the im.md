# PREFACE  

The functions of the Minister of Public Service and Administration as enshrined in the Public Service Act, 1994 include the responsibility to develop the norms and standards for governance and management of electronic government in the public service. The Public Service Regulations, 2016 support the Act by directing the executive authority and head of a department to prepare a strategic plan and information and communication technology plan, respectively.  

These arrangements intend to strengthen information and communication technology (ICT) utilisation to support the achievement of the departmental targets and objectives by fostering the involvement of executive management in all important ICT decisions. This accountability enables the department to align the delivery of ICT services with the department’s strategic goals.  

The Public Service Corporate Governance of ICT Policy Framework version 2 (“Policy Framework”) seeks to provide the departments with direction to implement corporate governance of ICT within their sphere of accountability and responsibility. The leadership should provide the necessary business enabling policies, frameworks plans, structures, and other relevant resources.  

The Policy Framework supports the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2019 – 2024, Priority 1: Building a capable, ethical and developmental state through e-government to improve service delivery.  

Effective Corporate Governance of ICT is essential to ensure that ICT supports business goals, ensures benefit realization from ICT expenditure, and appropriately manages ICT-related business risks and resources.  

The existing Policy Framework that the Cabinet approved in 2012 focuses mainly on compliance with no performance considerations. This weakness was confirmed by the repeat audit findings of the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) on  IT governance weaknesses where IT projects do not meet the business expectations.  

The revised Policy Framework has been primarily developed to address performance shortcomings. It directs the strategic leadership of the department (executive management) to take responsibility for the governance of ICT equivalent to the other departments, including but not limited to finances and human resources.  

This Policy Framework aligns with the new developments that occur after the approval of the current Policy Framework, including but not limited to:  

Public Service Regulations, 2016; King IV code; and   
COBIT 2019.  

The implementation of this Policy Framework will be supported by implementation guidelines and templates issued by the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA).

# 1. PURPOSE  

The purpose of this Policy Framework is to institutionalise the corporate governance of ICT as an integral part of the corporate governance practices within departments in a uniform and coordinated manner.  

Corporate governance of ICT will create value for the department, e.g., improved service delivery, better use of limited resources, and improved performance and quality. It will also provide for performance measurement of ICT as a strategic enabler of the department business, thus driving their respective digital transformation strategies.  

The Policy Framework directs the strategic leadership of the department to take responsibility for the corporate governance of ICT and provide leadership for the use of ICT to support the achievement of the strategic objectives and goals of the department.  

# 2. SCOPE  

This Policy Framework for the corporate governance of ICT is applicable to all departments in the public service, as defined in section 197(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and section 7 of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation No. 103 of 1994), namely:  

National departments;   
Provincial departments;   
National government components; and Provincial government components.  

# 3. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  

All the relevant acts and prescripts that regulate the strategic planning and corporate governance of the department are applicable to the ICT environment, such as:  

Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, section 197(1); Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000 (Act No. 2 of 2000); Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (Act No. 4 of 2013). Public Administration Management Act, 2014 (Act No. 11 of 2014), section 14; Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999); Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation No. 103 of 1994); Public Service Regulations, 2016; and • Any other legislation applicable to the department.  

# 4. APPLICABILITY  

As departments differ in purpose, function, complexity, and size (culture, goals, risks, compliance requirements, etc.), there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This Policy Framework recognises this diversity. It is thus not possible to produce a blueprint of an enabling environment applicable to all departments.  

This Policy Framework provides explanatory principles, practices, and the governance system to support and sustain effective departmental arrangements for using ICT in the public service.  

# 5. BACKGROUND  

In February 2013, the Minister of Public Service and Administration (MPSA), through Cabinet (Cabinet Memorandum No. 41 of 2012, dated 21 November 2012), issued the Public Service Corporate Governance of ICT Policy Framework and the related Corporate Governance of Information ICT Implementation Guideline and Corporate Governance of ICT Assessment Standard ("the Assessment Standard").  

Since 2013, the introduction of the Policy Framework has improved awareness in the public service of the need for improved governance of ICT, as shown in several periodic assessment findings from the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation's (DPME’s) Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT). This area's maturity levels (adoption and adaption) remain varied across the public service, as confirmed by the AGSA audit outcomes. For example, the recent 2020/21 financial year AGSA audit outcome still highlighted that $63\%$ of auditees had weak IT governance practices, demonstrating a lack of accountability and oversight by those charged with overseeing IT performance and risk management.  

Considering the above situation, combined with the compliance-focused approach of the 2012 approved Policy Framework, the need for a revised version became urgent and apparent.  

# 6. INTRODUCTION  

ICT has evolved and brings about new opportunities for the public service to expedite service delivery, reach citizens promptly, and promote two-way online communication between government and service beneficiaries. Furthermore, it provides public service senior management with the ability to make informed decisions based on easily accessible and reliable information.  

To derive the expected value from the ICT investments, departments should strengthen ICT prescripts, ICT plans, ICT-enabled projects, and institutional arrangements. Therefore, executive management needs to incorporate ICT governance into existing corporate governance arrangements to oversee the performance of ICT.  

The objectives of this Policy Framework are to instil:  

(a) Executive management involvement and leadership in the governance of ICT within departments to create value and improve performance;   
(b) Transparency, accountability, and efficiency in matters related to the management of ICT; and   
(c) Enhanced level of ICT compliance and performance at a departmental level and in the public service.  

# 8. BENEFITS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT  

When the corporate governance of ICT is effectively implemented and maintained, the following benefits, among other things, are to be realised:  

(a) Deriving business value from ICT investment;   
(b) Using, which includes sharing of departmental resources (including but not limited to people, process, information and communication technology) when investing in, operating and using ICT;   
(c) Mitigating ICT-related business risks of investing, owning, operating, and using ICT within a secure environment;   
(d) Improving ICT's ability to learn and the agility to adapt to changing circumstances; and   
(e) Improving ICT monitoring, evaluation, auditing, and reporting.  

# 9. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE  

# 9.1 Corporate governance  

King IV defines corporate governance as the exercise of ethical and effective leadership by the governing body towards the achievements of the following governance outcomes:  

Ethical culture; Good performance; Effective control; and Legitimacy (IODSA, 2016).  

When applied in the public service, corporate governance encompasses the mechanisms by which departments and those in leadership are held to account, the risk is monitored and assessed, and performance is optimised.  

It provides an appropriate control environment that enables strategic leadership and management to discharge their responsibilities and oversee compliance with legislation and prescripts.  

# 9.2 Corporate governance of ICT  

Corporate Governance of ICT involves evaluating and directing ICT use to support the organisation and monitoring this use to achieve plans (ISO/IEC 38500:2015).  

Corporate governance of ICT is a subset of the department's corporate governance system (also called departmental arrangements) and consists of principles and practices within a system that enables strategic leadership to execute their oversight roles and responsibilities.  

King IV code, Principle 12 states: “The governing body should manage technology and information in a way that supports the organisation in setting and achieving its strategic objectives” (IoDSA, 2016).  

COBIT 2019 resonates with the King Code’s provisions. It highlights that the boards must exercise oversight to “enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from I&T-enabled business investments” (ISACA, 2018).  

Because information is a critical asset in any organisation, its management, including the associated technological channels, requires the attention of decision-makers to ensure that information assets are utilised for the intended purposes. Therefore, decision-makers need to have appropriate governance oversight over technology that produces information and information itself. In view of departments' dependency on ICT for their successful existence and that ICT must be governed from the highest level of authority, corporate governance of ICT must be an integral part of the corporate governance system of departments. This approach will enable strategic leadership to execute their accountability and strategic leadership roles and responsibilities.  

The corporate governance of ICT is implemented within the accountability structure of the department, as discussed in Section 11 of this Policy Framework.  

# 10. LAYERED APPROACH TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT  

Corporate governance of ICT encompasses two levels of decision-making, i.e., governance and management. There must be a clear distinction between these two layers, namely:  

Corporate governance of ICT: the Executive Management Committee (EXCO) is accountable for achieving the department’s mandate and strategic objectives through, among other things, the use of ICT. The accountability for corporate governance of ICT must be facilitated through clearly defined, implemented, and audited controls.  

Management of ICT: the responsibilities and activities of ICT management and corporate governance of ICT differ.  

ICT management entails a process whereby all operational activities concerning ICT resources are aligned to the department’s priorities and needs. It includes tangible resources like networking hardware, computers, and people and intangible resources like software and data. The central aim of ICT management is to generate value through technology.  

The ICT function is responsible for managing ICT processes that will ensure the effective and efficient execution and monitoring of ICT.  

# 11. ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURE FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT  

Irrespective of the type of department, be it a national or provincial department, the corporate governance of ICT accountability structure provides for the roles and responsibilities of the different levels of corporate governance.  

# 11.1 Governance structures  

# 11.1.1 EXCO  

The structure that has the highest level of accountability for the governance and performance of a department must provide monitoring and oversight to ensure that the use of ICT supports the achievement of the department’s strategic objectives.  

This governance structure must ensure that corporate governance of ICT is included in the corporate governance regime of the department and that the necessary governance structures, policies, and processes are in place, monitored, and enforced.  

In addition to other EXCO roles and responsibilities, this structure Evaluate, Direct and Monitor the effectiveness of the departmental ICT governance system, including but not limited to:  

Approve CGICT Policy, ICT plan (MTEF), ICT operational plan, and other related plans and policies;   
Provide strategic direction to ICT by outlining the departmental strategic plan; Monitor that the ICT plan supports the department to deliver on its objectives per the strategic plan; Monitor and evaluate the performance of the ICT governance structures and processes; Approve portfolio of ICT projects and their related expenditure; and   
Oversee the implementation of the CGICT Policy Framework and associated policies and strategies.  

# 11.1.2 ICT steering committee  

Responsible for ensuring that departmental arrangements for the corporate governance of ICT are developed, implemented, managed, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore, the ICT steering committee is responsible for creating an environment that improves the financial and performance management of ICT and managing ICT risks within the risk appetite of the department.  

The ICT steering committee is responsible for:  

Providing oversight on the management and use of ICT in the department;   
Providing strategic leadership towards the digitalization of the department, including ICT projects and services; Monitoring the joint ICT planning and resourcing of the ICT programme across the department; Monitoring the implementation of approved plans, policies, strategies; Monitoring that ICT related business risks are mitigated, benefits realization from the ICT investments (portfolio of ICT projects), and audit issues from assurance providers; and Providing recommendations and reporting to EXCO on pertinent ICT issues, including ICT strategies and plans.  

# The ICT steering committee must operate as a project steering committee where  

no separate committee exists.  

# 11.2 Roles and Responsibilities  

# 11.2.1 Head of Department  

Provides strategic leadership to ensure efficient and effective use of ICT within the department as contemplated in regulation 30 of the Public Service Regulations, 2016. The Head of Department is responsible for creating an environment that helps improve the department's financial and performance management. The Head of Department is the designated governance champion accountable for the corporate governance of ICT and is responsible for the establishment of corporate governance of the ICT system and monitoring of its performance. The corporate governance champion responsibility may be delegated to a person on a senior management level with the authority to establish and monitor the corporate governance of the ICT system across the different business units.  

However, accountability for the performance of the corporate governance of the ICT system shall remain with the governance champion.  

It is recommended that the responsibilities of the governance champion include the following:  

(a) Overseeing that the corporate governance of ICT system, as a subset of Corporate Governance, is developed, implemented, maintained, reported on, and change management effected; and   
(b) Being actively involved in the oversight of the formal corporate governance system of the department.  

The governance champion must be supported by a cross-functional team that must include business and ICT.  

# 11.2.2 Head of ICT  

Responsible for aligning the use of ICT, as a strategic resource, with the business requirements in fulfilling its strategic mandate within a secure information environment. Other responsibilities include:  

Overseeing and directing the day-to-day activities of the departmental ICT  

department, ensuring that systems, services, and infrastructure work reliably and securely, and   
Participation in developing the digital transformation strategy focusing on the department's optimization and transformation of ICT.  

The Head of ICT must manage the ICT function through a defined IT Service Management policy.  

The Head of ICT must attend EXCO meetings. In these meetings, the Head of ICT must identify and implement possible solutions for ICT use to achieve the department's objectives.  

Although this Policy Framework does not address the management of ICT aspects in detail, the Head of ICT will be responsible for providing a regular executive summary to the ICT steering committee and EXCO on the following key general IT controls:  

Information security management;   
User access management;   
ICT service continuity;   
Management of external service providers ( $3^{\mathsf{r d}}$ parties); and Configuration management (IT assets lifecycle management).  

In addition, the Head of ICT is responsible for reporting to EXCO on key ICT operational matters that potentially impact the achievement of departmental objectives through the implementation of ICT-enabled projects.  

# 12. POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE  

This Policy Framework provides for the following:  

1. Principles are rules (compulsory to comply with) that guide decision-making and behaviour. These principles establish the context for effective, efficient, and acceptable use of ICT. The principles guiding corporate governance of ICT in the public service are given in Section 13 of this Policy Framework.  

2. Practices are specific actions that prescribe how and by whom the principles will be implemented. The practices that are in support of the principles are given in Section 13 of this Policy Framework.  

3. A system is a set of means and mechanisms that enable the implementation of corporate governance of ICT. In this system, executive and strategic leadership are primary to sustained corporate governance of ICT. The system explains how the ICT effort of a department is governed through the governance tasks of evaluating, directing, and monitoring. The system to implement corporate governance of ICT is discussed in Section 14 of this Policy Framework.  

The principles and practices are implemented within an accountability structure in the department, as discussed in the following section.  

# 13. PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES  

This Policy Framework is based on priorities stated in the National Development Plan 2030, the Public Service Act, 1994, the Public Service Regulations, 2016, and the Public Administration Management Act, 2014. It is underpinned by concepts, such as principles, practices, and a system, from the King IV Code of Governance for South Africa (2016) and the International Organization for Standardization's ISO/IEC 38500:2015.  

Table 1 below contains the principles that are compulsory to comply with and explains the practices that should be adapted and adopted to suit the unique context and ecosystem of the department.  

# Table 1: Corporate governance of ICT principles and practices

information and communication technologies by the department enhances direct or indirect service delivery to the public, including but not limited to equal access by the public to services delivered by the department. The PSR further provides for the head of department to ensure that such acquisition, management, and use of information and communication technologies improve the department's productivity. In terms of governance of ICT, this shall include:  

1.1 Ensuring that corporate governance of ICT is included in the strategic leadership and oversight responsibility of the department to achieve the strategic objectives of the department;   
1.2 Providing strategic structural requirements of the ICT function to provide adequate capacity and capability for the use of ICT to enable business; and   
1.3 Ensuring that ICT planning methodology and instruments are aligned with the business requirements.  

# Principle 2: Institutionalisation of corporate governance of ICT  

Corporate governance of ICT must be institutionalised within the corporate governance regime of the department.  

# Practices:  

2.1 Ensuring that corporate governance of ICT is embedded in the corporate governance regime of the department; and   
2.2 Providing oversight to ensure that effective ICT prescripts, structures, strategic plans, and corporate governance of the ICT system (see Section 14) are institutionalised to evaluate, direct, and monitor ICT use.

All ICT investments must achieve the predetermined value and benefits.  

# Practices:  

As contemplated in section 38(a)(iii)(b) of the Public Financial Management Act (PFMA), 1999, the accounting officer must ensure that the department has and maintains an appropriate procurement and provision system which is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective. The PFMA further provides for the accounting officer to ensure that the department has and maintains effective, efficient, economical, and transparent use of the department's resources. In terms of governance of ICT, this shall include:  

3.1 Ensuring that responsible ICT investment practices are in place to promote good governance and the creation of value and benefits;   
3.2 Determining upfront the expected benefits and value from an ICT investment;   
3.3 Oversee the value and benefits delivered through these major ICT investments and significant ICT operational expenditure;   
3.4 Concurrence of the Head of ICT in all ICT related decisions, including procurement; and   
3.5 Ensuring that an executive manager responsible for the ICT initiative/project signs off, confirming value realization as per the figure below.

6.2 Overseeing compliance with regulatory prescripts, policies, and standards that have an impact on the performance of ICT; and   
6.3 Overseeing performance against targets and objectives (benefits realisation, alignment with business goals, risk management, and resource optimisation).  

# 14. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ICT SYSTEM  

This Policy Framework will be institutionalised through corporate governance of the ICT system, which explains the relationship between governance, strategic leadership, and management and their associated responsibilities.  

The corporate governance of the ICT system is the system by which the current and future use of ICT resources is directed and controlled to facilitate the achievement of the department’s strategic objectives. It refers to all the means and mechanisms that enable the department’s EXCO, Head of Department, and ICT steering committee to provide direction and oversight.  

The system mentions the corporate governance tasks of evaluating, directing, and monitoring used to apply the principles and practices, as explained in Section 13. The functioning of the corporate governance of the ICT system is depicted in Figure 1 below.  

![](images/a1c669830171d1b11702e5ecc73d70a066f946933ffc7cd2f66a852709e3bcc3.jpg)  
Figure 1: Corporate governance of the ICT system  

(Adapted from ISO/IEC 38500: 2015(a))  

At the core of the corporate governance of the ICT system are leadership, structures, prescripts, and procedures to evaluate, direct and monitor the efficient and effective use of ICT to achieve the strategic mandate and objectives of the department, appropriate management of risks and responsible use of resources. It includes determining the alignment between business requirements and ICT plans;  

Through these governance tasks, stakeholder needs and options are evaluated to determine the departmental objectives. Direction is provided through prioritisation of proposals/options, and decision-making and monitoring are done by measuring performance and compliance against agreed-on direction and objectives;  

EXCO, which is accountable, provides the strategic direction of the department. The strategic direction and the external and internal context determine the strategic objectives. The management of business execution is done through the organisational structure and use of the relevant resources;  

The different accountability structures must monitor, evaluate and report on the execution of these initiatives to ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved within the prescriptive and a secure environment; and All the ICT-related initiatives, such as regulatory prescripts, standards, and transversal initiatives, which impact ICT performance, must be reviewed regularly.  

# 15. IMPLEMENTATION OF A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF THE ICT SYSTEM  

Corporate governance of the ICT environment is established by developing and implementing means and mechanisms such as strategies, structures, policies, frameworks, procedures, plans, controls, change management, and ethical culture. (A minimum enabling environment must be created through these means and mechanisms.) Departments must adopt the Policy Framework and adapt it to suit their unique context and ecosystem and explain how their system sustains the principles and practices.  

• The principles (rules) must specify the preferred behaviour that will guide decision-making.   
• The practices (actions) must explain how and by whom these principles will be implemented within the department.   
• The system (means and mechanisms) must enable the department’s EXCO, Head of Department, and ICT steering committee to provide direction and oversight  

The departmental corporate governance of ICT arrangements must show:  

(a) The scope and regulatory requirements applicable to corporate governance of ICT as applied to the specific department;   
(b) The departmental interpretation of how the corporate governance of ICT objectives will be applied;   
(c) How the ICT strategic objectives will be aligned with departmental strategic objectives, monitored, and reported on to the relevant stakeholders to create value through the use of ICT;   
(d) The departmental interpretation of how the principles and practices will be applied;   
(e) How the system of corporate governance of ICT will be implemented within the department; and   
(f) How the departmental corporate governance of ICT will be maintained.  

Departments must clearly indicate their related structures and procedures and the accountability and responsibilities that are allocated to each. This responsibility assignment can be reflected in a responsibility, accountability, consultation, and information (RACI) chart.  

Existing structures can be used to perform these functions.  

# 15.1 Business enabling policies, frameworks, and plans  

To enable the performance of ICT, specific business-related policies and/or frameworks are required, e.g.:  

(a) Departmental corporate governance of ICT policy – departments must develop departmental corporate governance of ICT policy in line with a DPSA policy template. This policy must provide explanatory principles, practices, and corporate governance of the ICT system to support and sustain effective departmental arrangements for ICT use within the department.  

(b) Information security policy – departments must develop an information security policy, which is an overarching policy, including cybersecurity, and related sub-policies such as:  

access management;   
incident management;   
problem management; and   
change management (including patch management).  

These ICT security prescripts must indicate how the department will manage the protection of electronic information, related systems, and infrastructure.  

ICT service continuity plan – departments must develop an ICT continuity plan aligned with and informed by the departmental business continuity plan, which is the responsibility of Enterprise Risk Management.  

(d) ICT project management framework – departments must adopt and develop a project management framework to manage ICT initiatives. ICT projects should be embedded in the departmental portfolio, programme, or project management structures to ensure ICT project oversight.  

At a minimum, the Framework must address the following deliverables:  

Project Governance (roles and responsibilities);   
Project Conceptualisation;   
Project Prioritization;   
Project Initiation;   
Project Planning;   
Project Execution;   
Project monitoring and control;   
Quality Management; and Risk Management.  

All investments for the business enabling ICT projects and ICT operational projects exceeding R10 million rands or projects cutting across government must have an approved business case.  

(e) ICT end-user policy (acceptable use) – departments must develop a policy to ensure proper use of departmental ICT assets. The policy must apply to any ICT asset the department has or may install in the future, including but not limited to email, Internet, mobile data cards, and desktop computing.  

(f) IT service management policy – departments must develop a policy defining the implementation and management of quality ICT services that meet the business needs. This policy must serve as the ICT function commitment to serve the business.  

At a minimum, the policy must address the IT Service Lifecycle Management, highlighting the following aspects:  

Service Level Management (service catalog, service requests, and turnaround times or service targets);   
Availability management (availability plan);   
Demand management (capacity versus demand);   
ICT financial management (costs, charges, and budget);   
Supplier Management (management of external service providers); and   
Configuration management (IT assets lifecycle management).  

# 16. ICT ALIGNMENT PLANNING  

Departments must use ICT as a strategic resource to create value by enabling its strategic mandate and objectives. To achieve this, departments should plan over the long, medium, and short term for ICT to enable the business and create value for the department.  

ICT planning must follow the relevant planning prescripts, methodology, and planning periods. This planning practice culminates in the following plans:  

(a) Departmental strategic plan – departments must indicate how ICT will be used to support the achievement of the departmental targets and objectives as contemplated in regulation 25 of the Public Service Regulations, 2016.  

(b) ICT plan (three-year plan) – departments must develop and maintain an ICT plan aligned to the medium-term expenditure framework for the department. This plan must address the people, processes, and technology matters to achieve departmental objectives as contemplated in regulations 25 and 38 of the Public Service Regulations, 2016.  

(c) ICT operational plan (one-year plan) – departments must develop and maintain an ICT operational plan that reflects the current year's implementation and monitoring of ICT initiatives and projects.  

# 17. MONITORING AND EVALUATION  

The implementation of the Policy Framework is measured through the Assessment Standard and/or other related standards.  

(a) The Assessment Standard will measure the compliance with the Policy Framework and the performance of the ICT function to enable the achievement of business objectives and value creation for the department. The Assessment Standard includes a balanced scorecard with guiding criteria to assess the compliance and performance of ICT.   
(b) This Assessment Standard will provide departments with self-assessment criteria to measure ICT compliance and performance.   
(c) The Assessment Standard will also be used by the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) to measure performance and compliance with the corporate governance of ICT standards.  

# 18. GOVERNMENT-WIDE ICT PROJECT GOVERNANCE MECHANISM  

The AGSA data shows that the individual departmental intervention plans to address the recurring AGSA findings on Information Systems audits are not yielding the expected results. As a result, the government urgently requires a government-wide ICT project governance mechanism to provide quality assurance on significant ICT projects impacting several departments. This mechanism will ensure that no largescale project is managed on a standalone basis and provides oversight on significant investment projects. The details of this mechanism will be dealt with separately.  

# 19. NON-COMPLIANCE  

Failure to comply with this Policy Framework will be dealt with in line with the provisions of the Public Service Act, 1994, sections 16A and 16B.  

# 20. CONCLUSION  

Implementing this Policy Framework promotes efficient and effective ICT governance for the departments to achieve their strategic objectives through the governing tasks of evaluating, directing, and monitoring.  

Departments must apply corporate governance of ICT by adopting the principles and practices put forward in this Policy Framework (comply with) and adapting their governance system to align with their departmental context (explain) while keeping the intent of this Policy Framework intact.  

The Assessment Standard will be based on a balanced scorecard for implementing corporate governance of ICT for both compliance measurement and performance measurement levels.  

This Policy Framework must be institutionalised through corporate governance of the ICT system, which guides the relationship between governance and management and their associated responsibilities.  

This Policy Framework serves as the foundation for the corporate governance of ICT in the public service. Changes or enhancements to this policy will be dealt with through directives and determinations addressing specific subjects

# 1. INTRODUCTION  

This Annexure provides more detail on the Corporate Governance of ICT (CGICT) on ICT portfolio, programme and project management methodology.  

The prioritization and planning of ICT projects are to execute ICT Medium-Term Expenditure as determined by the ICT plan (three-year plan), linked to the ICT annual operational planning (ICT operational plan).  

# 2. PURPOSE  

This Public Service Corporate Governance of ICT Project Management Guideline (herein called Project Management Guideline) guides departments in planning and executing their ICT projects.  

# 3. ICT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY  

ICT Portfolio management is defined as applying systematic management to ICT components' investments, projects and activities.  

The portfolio of ICT programmes and related projects are informed by the initiatives depicted in the ICT plan (three-year plan). From the ICT plan (three-year plan), ICT initiatives translate into projects implemented in the current year as part of the ICT operational plan. However, the portfolio and its related programmes and projects can be planned over a more extended period in the case of multi-year projects as informed by the ICT plan (three-year plan) roadmap.  

# 3.1 ICT Portfolio Management  

Portfolio Management is a collection of ICT projects or programs grouped to facilitate effective work management to meet strategic objectives. It should be embedded in the departmental Portfolio/Programme/Project management structures. It must include how the department will create the necessary capacity to manage ICT-related business programmes/projects/initiatives.  

A portfolio is a group of ICT projects under a coordinated management structure in the ICT context.  

Managing several projects in a portfolio is a mechanism to increase the effectiveness of the entire department. It provides a holistic view of all ICT projects. These projects are prioritized, and limited ICT resources are channelled to initiatives and projects that will provide maximum value to the department.  

There must be a continuous alignment of progress (projects and programmes) with the department's strategic direction. This alignment means that the department has to balance the relationships of a project to programme, project-to-project, programmeto-programme and projects/programmes to the business.  

# 3.2 ICT Programme Management  

Programme management is the process of managing a group of related ICT projects under a coordinated management structure to improve the department's performance.  

# 3.3 ICT Project Management  

ICT Projects should be managed in line with an established project management methodology.  

# 4. ICT PROJECT GOVERNANCE  

Each project will be governed in line with its requirements. The business owner will determine the governance mechanisms. It should address the following:  

Project governance structure:  

The following roles must be clearly defined:  

Business Owner; Project Sponsor;   
Project Steering Committee; Project Management Team   
Project Champion (business project manager); and   
Where applicable, ICT Project Manager.  

# 4.1 Business Owners  

The business owners function on an executive leadership level. They carry the authority to structure the business to execute its mandate. They are responsible for providing strategic direction to their responsibility area, directing work effort in line with the business strategy, delegating responsibility for execution of the mandate account for the business's performance, and resolving cross-functional area problems.  

They are responsible to:  

(a) Provide leadership for the ICT enablement of the business; (b) Consider all areas of the business and its implication in the formulation of the project;  

(c) Accept or approve the project plans; and (d) Monitor and provide oversight for the execution of the project.  

# 4.2 Project Sponsor  

The person who champions the cause throughout the project. It will generally be a senior member of staff within a relevant area of responsibility that will be affected by the project's outcome. They are involved from the start of the project, including defining the project in conjunction with the Project Manager(s). Once the project has been launched, they should ensure that it is actively reviewed to ensure the project's desired outcome and deviations are appropriately managed.  

The Project Sponsor is responsible to:  

(a) Act as a champion of the project;   
(b) Account for the delivery of planned benefits associated with the project;   
(c) Ensure resolution of issues escalated by the Project Manager or the Project steering committee;   
(d) Sponsor the communications programme; communicates the programme's goals to the department as a whole;   
(e) Make key departmental decisions for the project;   
(f) Assure availability of essential project resources;   
(g) Approve the budget and decides on tolerances;   
(h) Lead the Project steering committee; and   
(i) Be an ultimate authority and responsibility for the project.  

# 4.3 Project Steering Committee  

A project steering committee should be established and usually is composed of executive and senior management responsible for overseeing the project's progress and reacting to any strategic problems.  

The project steering committee will be responsible for the overall progress monitoring, high-level risk and high-level change management of the project, such as:  

(a) Setting the tone for cooperation between all relevant parties;   
(b) Representing stakeholders that do not directly sit on the steering committee;   
(c) Ensuring equality in decision-making;   
(d) Acting as the ultimate decision-maker in handling executive, legal, organizational, technical, cost, management, cultural and personnel issues;   
(e) Developing a project charter formalizing these roles and responsibilities;   
(f) Managing project scope;   
(g) Championing business process improvement; (h) Obtaining support and agreement from stakeholders; (i) Resolving obstacles; and   
(j) Communicating to the stakeholders.  

# 4.4 Project Management Team  

The project management team is responsible for the day-to-day running of the project. The frequency of project progress meetings will be determined according to the project circumstances.  

The frequency and type of project communication with the stakeholders will be determined according to the project's needs.  

# 4.5 Project Manager(s)  

In conjunction with the Project Sponsor, the Project Manager is responsible for developing a definition of the project. The Project Manager then ensures that the project is delivered on time, to budget and within the required quality standard (within agreed specifications).  

The Project Manager is responsible, among other things, for project planning, scope management, resources, budget, financial management, risk management, contingency planning, escalation of problems, identifying and tracking of milestones, project review, effective communication, stakeholder management and reporting on project status, key project decisions, team management, project delivery, testing, signoff and finally project closure.  

The Project Manager is also responsible for managing the work of consultants, allocating and efficiently utilizing resources and maintaining a cooperative, motivated and successful team.  

In the case of business enabling projects, it is recommended that both the business and the ICT function appoint project managers to the project. From the business perspective, this project manager will drive the business adoption of the project. From the ICT perspective, the project manager will drive the technology adoption of the project.  

# 5. PROJECT PRIORITIZATION  

During developing a portfolio of ICT projects, the prioritization of projects is informed by the initiatives approved in the ICT plan (three-year plan) reflecting budget priorities.  

However, as many departments have learned, the planned budget may not align with the actual budget. Therefore the portfolio of projects should be revised annually to consider budget reprioritization.  

This revision should be considered in the light of the following:  

Strategic Alignment: Initiative priorities are reflected in the approved ICT plan (three-year plan) aligned with the department's strategic plan.   
Value delivery: optimizing expenses, proving the value in line with the available budget derived from the project investment, and when the value will be achieved.   
• Risk management: Identification of the key project risks and related tolerances. Safeguarding ICT assets and providing for disaster recovery and continuity of operations.   
• Project selection management: Determine the impact of all the projects on each other. Identify under-performing projects and take necessary actions. If necessitated, terminate a project. Determine the department's capability and capacity to deliver and absorb all this change.  

# 6. PROJECT PLANNING  

The planning of ICT projects must be informed by the initiatives approved in the ICT plan (three-year plan).  

There must be an approved:  

(a) Business Case for each initiative, addressing issues such as the: scope, how it links to the strategic objectives of the department (business drivers), timelines, financial metrics, human resource requirements, benefits, value management practices (e.g. increased productivity, improved service delivery, investment management and cost-effectiveness).  

Other considerations are ICT security implications, risks and how the risks will be mitigated, interoperability, digital inclusion, the economy of scale and elimination of duplication.  

The Business Case serves as motivation for the project's approval, monitoring, and evaluation.  

# A guideline for the development of a Business Case is provided in Annexure C.  

(b) Project Plan for each initiative, organizing and managing resources so that these resources deliver all the work required to complete a project within defined scope, quality, time and cost constraints.  

The project plan should address the charter, scope and specifications, schedule, budgeting and cost management, quality criteria, human resource management, communications, risk, and procurement management.  

The success of ICT projects is linked to a proper project planning model throughout the project lifecycle. As a result, an example of key aspects to consider from project initiation to closure is explained below.  

# 7.1 Project Initiation  

The ICT plan (three-year plan)  must direct the identification, planning and initiation of an ICT project and be motivated by an approved business case.  

# 7.2 Project Planning  

The project plan should reflect the following:  

(a) Project Charter, which formally authorizes the project and defines the proj resource structure, roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders and ro players;   
(b) Scope of the project;   
(c) Start date of the project;   
Areas included in the scope of the project;   
(e) Areas specifically excluded from the scope of the project;   
(f) Critical success factors;   
(g) Assumptions on which the successful implementation of the project is based;   
(h) Objectives of the project;   
(i) Deliverables per objective;   
(j) Work breakdown structure per deliverable;   
(k) Milestones per work package or deliverable (depending on circumstances);   
(l) Timelines for milestones;   
(m) Conclusion date;   
(n) Allocation of responsibilities per human resource;   
(o) Constraints; and (p) Project risks.  

# 7.3 Project Execution Management  

The following structures manage the project execution:  

(a) The project steering committee is responsible for the following: (i) Planning and directing the implementation of the project; (ii)  Oversee project progress and achievement of deliverables;  

(iii)  High-level risk and change management; and (iv)  Reporting of the progress of the project. ) The Project management team is responsible for the following: (i) Coordination of the implementation of the project; and (ii) Reporting to the project steering committee or ICT steering committee.  

# 7.4 Project Closure  

After the project, the project steering committee is responsible for the following:  

(a) Evaluate and report on the achievement of the objectives against the final Business Case;

# 1. BACKGROUND  

The Corporate Governance of ICT (CGICT) Policy Framework requires that there must be an approved business case for projects exceeding R10 million rands or projects cutting across government. The business case's determinations will monitor and manage the benefits, value, opportunities, costs, and risks resulting from such expenditure throughout the investment/project lifecycle.  

This Public Service CGICT Business Case Guideline provides guidance for developing a business case as required in the Public Service Corporate Governance of ICT Policy Framework.  

# 2. INTRODUCTION  

A business case is an assessment of the viability of an initiative. It will describe the reasons for considering undertaking a programme or project based on how it links to the strategic objectives of the department (business drivers). It includes consideration for timelines, financial metrics, estimated project costs and savings costs, human resource requirements, expected business benefits, and value (e.g., increased productivity or improved service delivery).  

Other considerations are ICT security implications, risks and how the risks will be mitigated, interoperability, digital inclusion, the economy of scale, and elimination of duplication.  

The business case must provide the necessary criteria that will motivate the approval, monitoring, and evaluation of the ICT initiative.  

The business case must contain the focus areas applicable within the departmental circumstances. The minimum proposed focus areas should include details of the business owner (the initiative requestor), project sponsor, business drivers, stakeholders, role players, resource requirements, business benefits, and risk mitigation (including security).  

# 3. PURPOSE OF THE BUSINESS CASE  

The business case is used to obtain authorization to proceed with the project and serves as a vehicle to obtain funding and resources for the proposed ICT initiative.  

The document will be used and maintained throughout the programme or project lifecycle and reviewed by the relevant oversight authority at key decision points.  

This document also addresses business arguments, decision points, and major reasons for proceeding. Answering: What, Why, How Much and How Long and For Whom.  

# 4. EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS CASE TEMPLATE  

Table 1 depicts details of the ICT initiative, such as the name of the ICT initiative, business unit, project manager, and project sponsor.

Draft 1.1</td><td></td><td>dd/mm/yyyy</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 4.1 Executive Summary  

Summarise the proposed ICT initiative. As the audience is executive management, the business case must be written in appropriate business language. Try to avoid the use of project or ICT terminology. Keep it brief.  

As the target audience might be very diverse, take cognizance of this diversity when constructing the business case. Your audience is very important.  

# 4.2 Background  

Provide short general background/history and a brief description of the current process and proposed business improvement.  

Describe the business environment and the primary drivers for the proposed change.  

# 4.3 Strategic Alignment  

Show how this ICT initiative is aligned with the department's strategic objectives.   
State what objectives the ICT initiative supports and how it supports those objectives.  

# 4.4 Promotes ICT plan (three-year plan)  

Show how this ICT initiative/project promotes the ICT plan (three-year plan).   
Indicate the required performance measures.  

# 4.5 Business Case Criteria  

The business case must indicate the set criteria for a business case to achieve the objectives, timelines, and elements. These criteria are as follows:  

Scope; Financial metrics; Human resources; Timelines; How it links to the strategic objectives of the department (business drivers); Value management practices (e.g., increased productivity, improved service delivery, investment management, and cost-effectiveness and benefits);   
Any ICT security implications, risks, and how the risks will be mitigated; Interoperability (seamless exchange of data and information access between the department's systems in line with Minimum Interoperability Standard (MIOS);   
Dependencies; Digital inclusion (provision of access to service beneficiaries located in areas where there is poor or no network coverage); The economies of scale; and Elimination of duplication.  

# 4.6 Motivation  

This section is the crux of the business case and should deal with motivations as to why the ICT initiative should be considered. Sufficient time for analysis should be directed at understanding and documenting the business challenge. Include any issues that have been identified as well as possible solutions for the problems.  

Describe how the business drivers support the strategic objectives of the department.   
Business drivers can be derived from the departmental Strategic Plan.  

A business driver is a business aspect that the solution is trying to address. E.g., the business unit or department may want to implement a system that will change some manual processes into automated ones. The business driver might be, e.g., improving the service delivery by being more efficient, improving productivity, faster processing time, or shorter queuing time.  

# 4.7 Situational Analysis  

# 4.7.1 Current Situation  

Describe the current situation and related issues.  

# 4.7.2 Future Situation  

Describe the proposed future requirement and any related issues that may occur.  

# 4.7.3 Gap Analysis  

Describe the gap between the current situation and future requirements – usually tabulated. See Table 2.  

Table 2: Situational Analysis   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Current BASELINE</td><td>Future TO BE</td><td>Gap Analysis Impact of the gap and what has to be done to solve or close it.</td></tr><tr><td>１</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>２</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>４</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 4.8 Alternatives Considered  

Thorough research for alternatives must be conducted. Identify and describe the alternative options considered to "close the gap" and address the criteria and critical success factors for implementing the proposed ICT initiative.  

Do not simply provide alternatives that will make a solution look good. Be as impartial as possible. Provide a minimum of three (3) viable, cost-effective options.  

Identify the alternative options. These proposed ICT initiatives must be benchmarked against the critical success factors and prioritized to determine which alternative will provide the best solution.  

# 4.9 Resource requirement  

The Human Resource requirement for each option also needs to be determined. Indicate what type of resources are required.  

Indicate the number of in-house and external resources and skills required for the ICT initiative.  

The required budget for each option also needs to be determined. See Appendix 1 of this document for an example of a business case budget.  

Table 3: Resource Requirement   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Project</td><td>Budget 20_/_</td><td>Resources</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 4.10 Critical Success Factors  

Based on the alternatives, identify and describe the critical success factors of implementing the proposed ICT initiative. These factors are both for making the business a success and for the success of the implementation of the proposed ICT initiative.  

# 4.11 Stakeholders  

Identify all the stakeholders impacted and expected to benefit from the proposed ICT initiative. A stakeholder is an entity that will be affected by implementing the ICT initiative. They are groupings of people, e.g., business unit, business area, department, etc. It is suggested that a comprehensive analysis is done.  

# 4.12 Role Players  

Identify all key role players needed to ensure the proposed ICT initiative's successful development, implementation, and maintenance. The roles and responsibilities of the role players must be clearly defined.  

# 4.13 Business Benefits  

All ICT investments must achieve pre-determined value and benefits.  

Business enablement value criteria for each ICT initiative must be declared upfront to measure its success against pre-determined measurement criteria such as value measurement and technology life cycle.  

See Annexure A, the Public Service Corporate governance of ICT Planning Guideline, for measurement criteria examples.  

# 4.13.1 Tangible Benefits  

A list of the tangible benefits that will be achieved because of this choice, e.g., cost savings, less staff, etc., something that you will be able to see and measure clearly, must be measurable and quantifiable.  

# 4.13.2 Intangible Benefits  

A list of the intangible benefits that will be achieved because of this choice, e.g., ease of use, better quality, and those things that are difficult to measure.  

# 4.14 Risks  

The ICT-related business risks, including security and cybersecurity, must be mitigated for all ICT initiatives/projects. List any risks associated with the proposal, identify the risk, the probability, and impact, and illustrate how to mitigate the risk.  

See Appendix 2 of this document for an example of a Risk Log.  

# 4.15 Major Assumptions Made  

List all assumptions on which the success of the solution has been based. Should any of these assumptions change materially, they could jeopardize the solution.  

# 4.16 Decisions Required  

List any business decisions that will have to be made to pursue the chosen option.  

# 5. CONCLUSION  

The business case must promote accountability, transparency, and early warning signals for all proposed ICT initiatives. Developing a complete business case for each ICT initiative/project (considering the context and circumstances of each department) contributes toward investing in ICT initiatives/projects that provide measurable value to improve service delivery and increase productivity. Furthermore, it provides a common platform to make informed decisions based on factual variables.  

Therefore, investing time and effort in developing a business case alleviates unintended consequences of investing without sound justification. Suppose the business case is appropriately used as an ICT initiative monitoring and evaluation instrument, it will substantially reduce the risk of project failure.

# Appendix 2 – Risk Log  

Risk Number A sequential number is allocated to the risk as it is identified   
Risk Title : Short title to identify the risk   
Category : Indicate the category of risk. For a comprehensive list of categories, refer to the Risk Management Strategy   
Probability : Graded from 1 to 3   
Impact Graded from 1 to 3   
Rating Multiply the Probability and Impact rating to give an overall rating for the risk and enable prioritization of risks   
Proximity Indicates if the risk affects the entire project or is relevant to a particular stage, characterized by date, e.g., Oct-Dec (this risk will most probably make an impact during October to December)   
Risk Description : Description of the cause and effect of an event   
Countermeasures : Describe the countermeasures to prevent, reduce, accept, transfer or put in place a contingency plan  

# Risk Quantification  

Risk needs to be quantified in two dimensions. The impact and probability of the risk occurring must be assessed. Rate each on a scale of 1 to 3.  

The larger the number, the larger the impact or probability.   
By using a matrix, a priority can be established.  

![](images/832c02ce96e05c1161844161ef4b47e1152dc39a16d9844a95b02e1adb0c1324.jpg)  

Note: If the probability is high and impact is low, it is a Medium risk. On the other hand, if the impact is high and the probability low, it is a High priority.
